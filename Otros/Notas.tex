\subsection{The membership of stars, density profile, and mass segregation in open clusters using a new machine learning-based method} % https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.523.3538N/abstract
The open clusters (OCs) are considered ideal systems for studying stellar astrophysical properties and the dynamics of stellar systems as their stars lie roughly at the same distance with the same age and chemical abundance, but different masses. In this regard, identifying the member stars is of great importance in determining the physical characteristics of star clusters. Therefore, identifying the member stars of OCs is of great importance in determining their astrophysical parameters (reddening, distance, and age), structural parameters (core, cluster, and tidal radii), overall masses, mass function, relaxation times, and evolutionary parameters. Moreover, the members of the OCs undergo internal and external perturbations such as stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, mass segregation, and Galactic tidal field. In this regard, the ongoing ESA space-based mission Gaia (Perryman et al. 2001; Gaia Collaboration 2016) is building the largest, most precise three-dimensional map of our Galaxy by surveying nearly two billion objects. Hence the deep observational study of star clusters is receiving a new impetus. There are two main approaches to identify cluster membership including the astronomical methods (which are based on the position and motion of the stars) and photometric methods (that derive from the colour and brightness of stars). Since cluster stars follow the same evolutionary path, they can also be identified photometrically using colour–magnitude diagrams by separating the cluster stars from the background stars using colour and brightness information. Using Gaia data release with its precise astrometric and photo-
metric parameters, considerable efforts have been expended in the
research of cluster stars membership such as: Kos et al. (2018),
Lodieu et al. (2019), Ma´
ız Apell´ aniz (2019), Alejo, Gonz´ alez \&
Veramendi (2020), and Miret-Roig et al. (2019).
To process such an extensive data base, the use of neural networks
and machine learning algorithms in different areas of astronomy
is mandatory. For example, the machine learning algorithms have
been used to detect reliable star cluster members, using the K-
means algorithm by El Aziz, Selim \& Essam (2016) and Cantat-
Gaudin T. et al. (2018), DBSCAN by Gao (2014), Gao, Chen \& Hou
(2014), Bhattacharya et al. (2017) and Wilkinson, Mer´
ın \& Riviere-
Marichalar (2018), spectral clustering by Gao (2018a), Random
Forest and Spectral clustering by Gao (2018b), GMM and Random
Forest by Gao (2018c, 2019a, b), KNN: K-Nearest Neighbors, and
GMM by Agarwal et al. (2021).
The latest release of Gaia data (EDR3, Gaia Collaboration 2016;
Brown et al. 2021) with improved precision, offers the opportunity
to revisit the OC membership and physical characteristics allow
the application of machine learning methods to search for the new
members that would go unnoticed with traditional methods. Here in
this paper, we investigate the efficient method by a combination of
suitable unsupervised machine learning algorithms DBSCAN and GMM for cluster membership and apply them to 12 OCs. The
combination of these two algorithms covers the weakness of each
method with the strength of the other one. The paper is organized as
follows: In Section 2, we explain the observational data. In Section 3,
the combined method of DBSCAN and GMM is described. This is
followed by a presentation of the results in Section 4. We compared
our method with other methods in Section 5. And finally, a discussion
of the results and conclusions are presented in Sections 6 and 7.

\subsection{A machine-learning-based tool for open cluster membership determination in Gaia DR3} %https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...675A..68V/abstract
The study of open clusters (OCs) has evolved rapidly in par- allel with the different data releases of the Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration 2016). A major step forward was the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2; Gaia Collaboration 2018), where the OC census was homogeneously studied for the first time, tak- ing advantage of the precise sky positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry in three different bands for more than 1 billion sources and the all-sky nature of Gaia. Using these data, Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018) were able to charac- terise over 1000 OCs in our Galaxy, providing accurate member- ship lists and mean astrometric parameters for them, and these authors classified some objects present in pre-Gaia catalogues (Dias et al. 2002; Kharchenko et al. 2013) as asterisms. More- over, the number of known OCs has increased with the discov- ery of hundreds of new objects, which only became detectable thanks to Gaia. Assisted by novel machine-learning techniques and a Big Data environment, Castro-Ginard et al. (2018) sys- tematically analysed the Galactic disc, searching for new OCs based on the clustering of stars in the five-dimensional astro- metric space, and confirmed the candidates they found as real objects with Gaia photometry (Castro-Ginard et al. 2019, 2020, 2022). Further studies contributed new objects to the OC population, and the OC catalogue currently consists of around 2500 objects (Sim et al. 2019; Liu \& Pang 2019; Ferreira et al. 2020; Hunt \& Reffert 2021; Dias et al. 2021). For this OC cata- logue, Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020) were able to estimate astro- physical parameters such as age, distance and extinction for most of the objects, which enabled dynamical studies of this population (Tarricq et al. 2021), and the relation of the younger OCs with the spiral arms (Castro-Ginard et al. 2021), providing a more complete view of the structure and evolution of our Milky Way (see also similar works on the OC catalogue Dias et al. 2021; Monteiro et al. 2021). Most of the previous studies involving large volumes of data rely on unsupervised learning techniques, mostly based on the clustering of stars, and have been limited to the bright end of the Gaia photometry, meaning stars with G ≤ 17 or 18 mag. Due to the increasing errors at fainter magnitudes, the compact- ness of the cluster is blurred and therefore the existing method- ologies are less efficient in finding real OC members. This can be overcome by the inclusion of supervised learning techniques able to learn the distribution of member stars around known OCs and find new members based on their similarities in a high-dimensional space. This family of methods has already been applied to characterise stellar streams (Balbinot et al. 2011) and detect new ones (Malhan \& Ibata 2018; Mateu et al. 2018), demonstrating the power of this tool in finding this kind of object (their elongated structure and wider range in parallax make them harder to study than OCs).
Finding members to magnitudes fainter than G = 18 mag is important for full characterisation of the OC population. The identification of low-mass members for OCs has many applica- tions, such as in testing initial mass functions and mass segre- gation effects, investigating the limits between stars and planets, and investigating the white dwarf population of these clusters. Having membership lists for the whole Gaia magnitude regime is also important for spectroscopic Gaia follow-up surveys. These forthcoming surveys, particularly WEAVE (Dalton et al. 2012) and 4MOST (deJongetal. 2012), are ground-based multi-object spectrographs that can observe around 1000 and 2400 objects simultaneously in fields of view of 2 and 4 square degrees, respectively. The target lists for both surveys are fully based on Gaia data and will complement Gaia with radial veloc- ities and astrophysical parameters derived from spectroscopy for stars fainter than GRVS ∼ 16 mag, which is the Gaia spectrograph magnitude limit.
The present work takes advantage of the more precise astrometry and photometry of Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) and Data Release 3 (DR3; Gaia Collaboration 2021, 2023, respectively) with respect to DR2 in order to complement existing OC membership lists for bright magnitudes (G ≤ 18) and find new members at the faint end. This paper is organ- ised as follows. In Sect. 2 we show the steps for constructing a set of members, non-members, and candidates for each clus- ter. In Sect. 3 we describe how we build a training and valida- tion dataset with the members and non-members, how we train the neural network, and how we apply the model to determine the membership probability of candidate members. To assess the performance of our method, in Sect. 4 we compare the OC mem- bership lists we obtain with independently determined mem- bership lists from Tarricq et al. (2022). Finally, we present our conclusions in Sect. 5.

\subsection{Survey for Distant Stellar Aggregates in the Galactic Disk: Detecting 2000 Star Clusters and Candidates, along with the Dwarf Galaxy IC 10} % https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..267...34H/abstract
Gaia is a billion-star surveyor that can achieve an astrometric uncertainty of tens of microarcseconds(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016). This makes it an invaluable tool for studying the Milky Way and stellar objects in it, especially open clusters (hereafter OCs)(Cantat-Gaudin 2022). OCs provide accurate distance and kinematics information through the astrometric data of cluster members and a valuable wide age range (from 1 Myr to <10 Gyr), which makes them ideal tracers for studying the Galactic structure and stellar evolution (e.g., Kuhn et al. 2019; Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2020; Castro-Ginard et al. 2021), as intended by the Gaia mission (Perryman et al. 2001).
In the past five years, researchers have been actively searching for undiscovered star clusters, with more than 5500 OCs and candidates detected using various methods after the second Gaia data release (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018; DR2). Three-quarters of these are newly found based on Gaia data, leading to a wealth of research on Gaia OCs (e.g., Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018, 2019; Castro-Ginard et al. 2019, 2020, 2022; Liu \& Pang 2019; Sim et al. 2019; Ferreira et al. 2020, 2021; Kounkel et al. 2020; He et al. 2021a, 2022a, 2022b, 2023; Hunt \& Reffert 2021; Hao et al. 2022b; Perren et al. 2022). However, not all possible clusters in Gaia data have been found, and recent reports show that new clusters are still being discovered (e.g., Hao et al. 2022a;
Casado \& Hendy 2023; Chi et al. 2023; Hunt \& Reffert 2023; Li \& Mao 2023; Qin et al. 2023).
Moreover, most of the Gaia OCs and candidates found in the Galactic disk are within 5 kpc, with only ∼370 having a parallax lower than 0.2 mas based on Gaia DR2/EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021). The primary limitation for finding distant OCs in Gaia data has been Galactic extinction, with most OCs found having an extinction value of less than Av = ∼3 mag (Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2020, hereafter CG20). OCs with an Av greater than 5 mag were not considered easy to detect, which has led to less focus on the search for those OCs. This absence of distant findings makes it challenging to trace the Galactic structures beyond 5 kpc based on OCs (e.g., Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018; He et al. 2021b). However, although the optical observation limitations exist in the Galactic disk, we believe that the vast astrometric data set in Gaia DR3 is still not being fully utilized.

\subsection{Identifying 46 New Open Cluster Candidates in Gaia EDR3 Using a Hybrid pyUPMASK and Random Forest Method} %https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..265...20C/abstract

Stars in open clusters (OCs) simultaneously formed from the same molecular cloud, and gravitationally bound stellar systems were born in the same starburst. Therefore, OCs are a kind of natural laboratory and are valuable tracers for studying galactic structure, chemical composition, and dyna- mical evolution, as well as providing validation and constraints on galaxy evolution models (Spina et al. 2022). For example, young OCs are often assigned to analyse the structure of galaxies. They are also used as testbeds to study stellar evolution, allowing us to investigate the boundary conditions necessary for new star formation (Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018). Besides providing information about the height and radial extension of the Galactic disk, old OCs also provide information about the chemical history of the Galaxy, e.g., the relationship between age and metallicity, mixing processes, and cluster destruction processes caused by interactions with other clusters.
However, due to the limitations of Galactic dust extinction and contamination of field stars (foreground and background stars), identifying OCs is still a challenging issue (Deb et al. 2022). Many efforts have been made to hunt OC candidates from the Gaia Second Data Release (Gaia DR2; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) and Gaia (Early) Data Release 3 (Gaia (E)DR3; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021).
Various methods based on unsupervised machine-learning clustering algorithms have been used to search for OCs. One of the most successful searching methods is the Density-based

Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm (Ester 1996). A series of DBSCAN variants based on DBSCAN is capable of effectively identifying OCs (Castro- Ginard et al. 2018, 2019, 2020; He et al. 2021; Castro-Ginard et al. 2022). In addition, Kounkel & Covey (2019), Kounkel et al. (2020), and Hunt & Reffert (2021) used the improved method Hierarchical Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) based on DBSCAN to detect many new clusters. Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018) applied an unsupervised membership assignment code (Unsupervised Photometric Membership Assignment in Stellar Clusters; UPMASK) to Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. Gao (2018) and Moriarty et al. (2020) identified cluster members using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering method.

\subsection{Hunting for Neighboring Open Clusters with Gaia DR3: 101 New Open Clusters within 500 pc} % https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..265...12Q/abstract
Open clusters (OCs) in the Milky Way are a collection of stars that are formed from the same molecular cloud and are gravitationally bound together (Lada & Lada 2003; Portegies Zwart et al. 2010), thus sharing similar specific characteristics (e.g., age, distance, reddening, metal abundance, etc.). OCs provide an ideal laboratory for studying star formation and evolution (Evans et al. 2009). Meanwhile, with its large sample, OCs are powerful tracers of the Galactic disk and can be used to constrain the Galactic structure and evolution history (Janes & Adler 1982; Dias & Lépine 2005).
As most Galactic OCs are located in the thin disk (Kharchenko et al. 2013), observations of OCs are often hampered by contamination from dominant background/fore- ground field stars, leading to more uncertainties in the characterization of cluster properties. Before the Gaia era, reliable member star selection was fairly difficult due to the limited astrometric precision, which brought about inconsis- tencies in the determination of basic parameters like the distances, kinematics, and ages of OCs (Netopil et al. 2015).
As one of the most successful and ambitious projects, Gaia enabled a deluge of scientific work including improving the quality of the cluster census. The Gaia DR2 catalog (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) presents more than 1.3 billion stars with unprecedented high-precision astrometric and photometric data, greatly improving the reliability of stellar membership determination and characterization of a large sample of OCs. The study of Galactic OCs has ushered in a new era. A more solid assessment of cluster membership using the precise Gaia data greatly promoted subsequent discoveries of new OCs. In the meantime, with the popularity of machine learning, cluster census efficiency has been tremendously raised. Many different methods have been used to search for new or re-detect existing OCs with Gaia data, especially various clustering algorithms such as unsupervised photometric membership assignment in stellar clusters (UPMASK; Krone-Martins & Moitinho 2014), Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN; Ester et al. 1996), Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN; Campello et al. 2013; McInnes et al. 2017), Gaussian mixture models (GMMs, Pearson 1894), the Friends of Friends algorithm (FOF; Huchra & Geller 1982), etc. Hunt & Reffert (2021) have made detailed comparisons for three main algorithms (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and GMMs) side-by-side, exploring their effectiveness in blind-searching of OCs with the large-scale Gaia data set. Based on Gaia DR2, Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018) applied the
UPMASK algorithm to select cluster members and provided an
updated catalog of 1229 OCs including previously reported
clusters and 60 newly discovered clusters. Liu & Pang (2019)
reported 76 new OCs by employing an FOF-based cluster
finder method to hunt out overdensities in (l, b, π, m*,3 μδ) a
space. In parallel, using the DBSCAN algorithm, Castro- Ginard et al. (2020) found 582 new cluster candidates located in the low-Galactic-latitude area by investigating the aggrega- tion of stars in the five-dimensional parameter phase space, with part of the candidates overlapped with the result of Liu & Pang (2019). Later on, Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020) compiled a comprehensive list of 1867 bona fide OCs reanalyzed with UPMASK and Gaia data, providing a large and homogeneous catalog of OC properties and the corresponding member stars. As the early stage of the Gaia third data release, Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) provides astrometric and photometric parameters of 1.5 billion sources with even higher accuracy than Gaia DR2, averagely increasing the precision of proper motion by 2–3 times and parallax by about 20\%. Solely based on the Gaia EDR3 database, Castro-Ginard et al. (2022) have proposed the OCfinder method, which employs the DBSCAN clustering algorithm for selecting overdensities in the five-dimensional astrometric space and incorporates a deep artificial neural network for distinguishing bona fide OCs in color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs). In their work, 628 new OCs were picked out, mostly located 1 kpc away from the Sun. In our recent work (He et al. 2022b), we carried out a blind search for new OCs using Gaia DR2/EDR3 by dividing low- Galactic-latitude regions into 2° × 2° (|b| < 5°) or 3° × 3°(| b| > 5°) grids, sequentially performing the DBSCAN and pyUPMASK clustering algorithms in five-dimensional phase space (dl*, db, va*, vδ, π). Eventually, 541 star clusters unrecorded in the literature were found, with a majority of them located beyond 1 kpc from the Sun, while only about 6\% are located within 500 pc to the Sun. Using a similar approach and with Gaia EDR3, He et al. (2022a) expanded their search grid to 12° × 12° or 18° × 18° to increase the number of clusters in the solar vicinity and cataloged 270 newly found cluster candidates within 1.2 kpc of the Sun, of which 179 new OC candidates are within 500 pc.
In most cases of the above systematic searches for new OCs, Gaiaʼs high-precision position (l, b), proper motion (m*a, μδ), and parallax (π) data were used to detect the aggregation characteristics of cluster members in multidimensional phase space, photometric data were assisted in confirming the reality of the OCs in CMDs and determining their basic properties by subsequent further analysis. On the other hand, these works have different features in their own methodology and procedure. The newly found objects greatly enrich our understanding of the Galactic OCs population, and they also indicate that the present OC sample is far from complete. It is anticipated that many new OCs still can be detected through the careful analysis of observational data.
The main difficulty in detecting OCs lies in the serious contamination of field stars, especially for nearby OCs, in which member stars cover a wide projected field of view and the proportion of background field stars could be over- whelming. This study aims to find new OCs in the solar neighborhood, with an effective way to decontaminate the background/foreground objects by astrometric data. For this purpose, we proposed a new approach of data “slicing” along the line-of-sight distance. In a systematic search of nearby OCs, we divided all-sky data into sub-blocks with different sizes in every 100 pc interval for reducing contamination of field stars as much as possible and highlighting the aggregation signal of cluster members in the multidimensional phase space.
This paper is the first of our serial work, focused on a comprehensive search for undetected clusters within 500pc from the Sun, solely based on the most recent precise Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) data set. With our novel slicing approach, we greatly improved the efficiency of detecting the nearby new OCs. Altogether we updated/derived the physical properties of 324 OCs, with 223 previously reported clusters and 101 newly detected clusters. The data we used in this work are introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the searching process with the new approach of data slicing along the line-of-sight distance. In Section 4, we describe the catalogs of OCs and their members. A discussion about cluster crossmatching and a property analysis is given in Section 5. Finally, we summarize in Section 6.
\subsection{Structural parameters of 389 local open clusters} % https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...659A..59T/abstract

Open clusters (OCs) are essential objects for better understand- ing the evolution of the stellar disk of the Milky Way. Most stars of the disk are thought to be born in OCs (Lada & Lada 2003), which dissipate into the field due to relaxation-driven mass loss or tidal perturbations, as recently reviewed by Krumholz et al. (2019). The morphology of OCs is directly related to these processes. OCs first have to survive an ini- tial gas expulsion (Baumgardt & Kroupa 2007) following the formation of their first stars. Then, they experience a violent phase of relaxation during which stars can be expelled and form tail-like structures depending on their star formation efficiency (Dinnbier & Kroupa 2020b) and the timescales of gas expulsion (Dinnbier & Kroupa 2020a), among other processes. In addition, young OCs may keep in their morphology the imprint of sub- structures from their parent molecular clouds (Alves et al. 2020). Recently, the hierarchical formation scenario has been proposed (McMillan et al. 2007) in order to explain the evidence of mass segregation in young clusters such as the Orion Nebula Cluster (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998). Because standard dynamical evolution is unable to explain these levels of mass segregation in young clusters (Bonnell & Davies 1998), this scenario postulates that stars form in small clumps that later merge to form larger mass-segregated systems. On the other hand, older clusters are governed by internal and external effects. Equipartition of kinetic energy via two-body relaxation has a direct consequence on the distribution of stars within a cluster. Massive stars within a cluster move toward its center, whereas low-mass stars move toward its outskirts in a mass-segregation process (Mathieu 1984; Kroupa 1995; de La Fuente Marcos 1996). At the same time, gravitational perturbations by giant molecular clouds, tidal stripping due to the Galactic potential, or spiral arm shocks per- turb the cohesion of star clusters and shape escaping stars into S- shaped tidal structures (Küpper et al. 2008; Dinnbier & Kroupa 2020a). Eventually, in their final stages, clusters may disinte- grate (Lamers & Gieles 2006) while their members mix with the Galactic field. The spatial distribution of members in OCs of various ages and in different environments can shed light on all these processes. In particular, structural parameters such as the size of the core, the presence of a halo or a tidal tail in the peripheral region, and the degree of mass segregation can bring new constraints to theoretical models. 
The successive publication of the second Gaia data release (DR2, Gaia Collaboration 2018) and of the early data release 3 (EDR3, GaiaCollaboration 2020) led to what could be called a revolution in the study of OCs. With almost 1.5 bil- lion sources with a full astrometric solution (position, proper motions, and parallaxes), the census of OCs as well as their characterization have been improved drastically. Many stud- ies took advantage of Gaia DR2 to compute new member- ships or to detect new clusters with very different techniques and algorithms. Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018a) computed mem- bership probabilities of 1229 OCs that were identified prior to Gaia by Dias et al. (2002) and Kharchenko et al. (2013) using the clustering algorithm UPMASK (Krone-Martins & Moitinho 2014). Hundreds of new OCs and their members were identi- fied by Castro-Ginard et al. (2018, 2019, 2020), who developed a machine-learning approach to spot over-densities in the five dimensional parameter space of positions, parallaxes, and proper motions. These works released a catalog of more than 600 new open clusters. Sim et al. (2019) visually inspected stellar dis- tributions in the Galactic coordinates and proper motion space and identified 207 new cluster candidates. Liu & Pang (2019) also used a friends-of-friends method that is widely used in the galaxy cluster community to identify 76 unreported clusters. Kounkel & Covey (2019) applied the unsupervised machine- learning algorithm HDBSCAN to identify not only clusters, but also moving groups and associations within 1 kpc. More recently, Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020), hereafter CAN+20, pub- lished a catalog of 2017 OCs that were previously identified by the aforementioned authors and determined their memberships, distances and ages in a homogeneous way. Most of these large- scale studies are focused on the inner parts of clusters and are therefore unable to provide members in the peripheral regions of OCs. The combination of the striking precision of the Gaia astrometric measurements and its all-sky coverage allowed the detection of prominent structures around some OCs by several groups. Röser et al. (2019), Meingast & Alves (2019), and Jerabkova et al. (2021) characterized the tidal tails of the Hyades at large spatial scales with different methods. The tidal tails of Coma Berenices, Ruprecht 147, Praesepe, Blanco 1, NGC 2506, and NGC 752 were discovered suc- cessively by Tang et al. (2019), Yeh et al. (2019), Röser et al. (2019), Zhang et al. (2020), Gao (2020), and Bhattacharya et al. (2021). Meingast et al. (2021) studied ten nearby (located closer than 500pc), prominent and young OCs and identified an extended population of stars around almost all of them. They referred to this as a corona. In general, OC shapes can be described with a dense core and an outer halo (or corona) with a low density of stars (Artyukhina & Kholopov 1964). As pointed out by Nilakshi et al. (2002) and more recently by Meingast et al. (2021), halos are much more extended than the cores, and they are thought to comprise a large number of cluster members. The most complete and enlightening studies of the morphol- ogy of OCs are those conducted in 3D. However, their major drawback is that a 3D study requires converting parallaxes into distances, which is no trivial transformation. As established by Bailer-Jones (2015), it requires the use of Bayesian inference and the choice of a prior. The prior depends on the aim of the study. Moreover, Gaia parallaxes have systematic errors and biases that have significantly improved in Gaia-EDR3 compared to Gaia-DR2 (Lindegren et al. 2021), but still translate into an elongated shape of the clusters along the line of sight. Conse- quently, 3D studies are limited to very nearby (<500 pc) OCs (Piecka & Paunzen 2021). In order to study the morphology of clusters farther away than 500 pc from the Sun, it is more effi- cient to work in 2D.
In this paper, we perform a membership analysis using Gaia EDR3 for a sample of known OCs closer than 1.5 kpc and older than 50 Myr, with a particular effort to detect new members at large distances from their center. Taking advantage of these new memberships, we study the shape of the OCs projected on the plane of the sky. We measure the core and tidal radii of the clus- ters, the elongation and the size of their halo, we search for tails, and we quantify the level of mass segregation. We evaluate how these properties correlate with the age and Galactic position of the clusters.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the selection of clusters, the Gaia EDR3 query, the clustering algo- rithm, and the new memberships. We analyze the radial profile in Sect. 3 and the different populations of each cluster through Gaussian mixture models (GMM) in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we present our study of the mass segregation, and Sect. 6 sum- marises our results.
\subsection{Tracing the Origins of Mass Segregation in M35: Evidence for Primordially Segregated
Binaries}
% https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad18bf/pdf
Open clusters (OCs) provide an important laboratory for
studying dynamical evolution and mass segregation, given their
typically extensive amount of stellar multiplicity and the
homogeneity of stellar properties such as age, distance,
metallicity, reddening, etc. in a given cluster. Through two-
body relaxation and other processes leading to energy
exchange between stars and binaries, star clusters are expected
to become (dynamically) mass segregated, where the more
massive objects in the cluster occupy a more centrally
concentrated spatial distribution than the lighter objects
(King 1962; Giersz & Heggie 1997). For a given mass range
in (primary) stars, binaries are expected to be more massive
than the single stars (since binaries contain two stars), and
therefore the expectation for relaxed clusters is that binaries
will be mass segregated with respect to single stars.
Furthermore, binary systems offer signi cant insight into the
dynamical evolution of OCs as most gravitational encounters in
OCs are expected to be in uenced by binaries, and can lead to
direct collisions, mergers, mass transfer, and energy exchanges
(e.g., Fregeau et al. 2004; Leigh & Sills 2011; de Grijs et al.
2017).
The dynamical states and evolution of young clusters are of
particular interest, as they are expected to retain their near-birth
(primordial) conditions. Searching for mass segregation in the

youngest clusters can address the question of whether mass
segregation may be primordial or largely attributed to
dynamical and relaxation processes. Some of the youngest
clusters that have been studied observationally for mass
segregation include NGC 2264 (3 Myr; Nony et al. 2021),
NGC 6231 (3–4 Myr; Raboud & Mermilliod 1998), IC 1590
(3.5–4.4 Myr; Kim et al. 2021), NGC 2516 (100 Myr; Pera
et al. 2022), and the Hyades (680 Myr; Evans & Oh 2022).
NGC 2264, NGC 6231, IC 1590, and NGC 2516 all show
evidence of primordial mass segregation. Each of these clusters
also has relaxation times that are  the cluster age. In particular
for NGC 6231, Raboud & Mermilliod (1998) concluded that
binaries (and other multiple systems) are more centrally
concentrated than single stars, likely as a result of stellar
formation processes and not through dynamical means. In
contrast, Raboud & Mermilliod (1998) nd the Hyades to
contain a highly mass segregated stellar population as a result
of dynamical relaxation. This may be due to the Hyades having
already undergone∼10 relaxation times. At an age of
∼130–200 Myr (McNamara & Sekiguchi 1986; Braden et al.
2008; Geller et al. 2010; McNamara et al. 2011; Leiner et al.
2015), M35 lies in between these previously studied clusters.
Numerical simulations of similar young clusters have also
been used to study the origin of mass segregation. Bonnell &
Davies (1998) found within their simulations that the most
massive members of a young OC most likely formed in the
center of that cluster. Pavlík (2020) concluded that binaries lead
to quicker dynamical evolution for an OC like the Orion
Nebula Cluster (ONC). Clusters with initially larger binary
fractions evolve more quickly due to the in uence of massive

nds that the ONC was likely primordially mass segregated.
Converse & Stahler (2010) determined through a simulation
that the Pleiades was also initially mass segregated.
M35, is another young and well-studied OC that is ripe for
studies of mass segregation. The cluster has multiple photo-
metric (von Hippel et al. 2002; Kalirai et al. 2003; Adkins et al.
2009) and kinematic (Mathieu 1983; Geller et al. 2010;
McNamara et al. 2011) studies that show M35 has a rich stellar
population including many binary stars. Furthermore, previous
studies found that though M35 is not yet completely relaxed,
only the more massive members appear to show some degree
of mass segregation (McNamara & Sekiguchi 1986; Barrado y
Navascués et al. 2001; Braden et al. 2008). Thus, M35 offers
an interesting test case for investigating the interplay between
primordial and dynamical mass segregation.
In this paper, we use high-precision photometry and
kinematic constraints from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) to
extend the analysis of mass segregation fainter (9 < G < 20)
and further out in radius from the cluster center (to a 1° . 78
radius, or roughly 10 core radii) than previous studies using a
new method of identifying photometric binary stars and their
masses. We focus on mass segregation of the binaries in M35,
and whether we nd evidence for primordial mass segregation.
In Section 2, we describe our methods and our stellar sample.
In Section 3, we investigate our data for mass segregation and
provide relaxation timescales for M35. In Section 4, we discuss
the origin of the mass segregation detection.

At high mass, the IMF is observed to
be generally top-heavy in dense cluster cores such as in the Arches
cluster (e.g. Stolte et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2006) and stars appear
to be preferentially located in the central parts of the clusters (e.g.
Subramanian, Sagar & Bhatt 1993; Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998;
Figer, McLean & Morris 1999; Stolte et al. 2002; Gouliermis et al.
2004; Lyo et al. 2004).

based on the coalescence of pre-stellar cores (PSCs) and their sub-
sequent gravitational collapse to produce stars (e.g. Nakano 1966;
Silk & Takahashi 1979; Elmegreen & Shadmehri 2003; Elmegreen
2004; Shadmehri 2004), (ii) the mass segregation of stars in the clus-
ter (e.g. Vesperini & Heggie 1997; Kroupa 2002; Mouri & Taniguchi
2002), and (iii) a renewed episode of gas accretion by the cluster
under favourable conditions, which leads to the formation of a new
generation of massive stars (e.g. Lin & Murray 2007). This latter
idea is somehow inconsistent with the fact that a cluster such as
the Arches cluster is overall very young (i.e. age∼ 2 ± 1 Myr),

While there is a large body of evidence suggesting that stars form in groups rather
than in isolation, the vast majority of stars in the Galaxy and neighboring systems are not
in obvious clusters or associations (e.g. Lada & Lada 2003; Bonatto & Bica 2011; Silva-Villa
& Larsen 2011). The seeming inconsistency between the unclustered nature of stars and the
presence of highly organized natal environments can be reconciled if the majority of clusters
are disrupted early in their lives.

METHOD AND APPLICATION TO THE SN 1987A FIELD∗}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...715....1D/abstract

In the current star formation paradigm, low-mass stars grow in
mass over time through accretion of matter from a circumstellar
disk (e.g., Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974; Appenzeller & Mundt
1989; Bertout 1989). This accretion process is believed to occur
via the magnetic field lines that connect the star to its disk and
that act as funnels for the gas (e.g., K¨ onigl 1991; Shu et al.
1994). The strong excess emission observed in most of these
pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars is believed to originate through
gravitational energy, released by infalling matter, that ionizes
and excites the gas. Thus, the excess luminosity of these objects
(the classical T-Tauri stars) can be used to measure the mass
accretion rate.

\subsection{The formation of a bound star cluster: from the Orion nebula cluster to the Pleiades}

% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001MNRAS.321..699K/abstract

In reality, stars appear to continue forming in a cluster for a few
Myr until the gas is expelled (Palla & Stahler 2000), and once a
star forms it decouples from the gas and either falls towards the
potential minimum or is already on a `virial equilibrium orbit'. In
any case, the accumulating stellar system will be virializing
constantly as new stars are added, while the stars formed less than a crossing time ago may be falling towards the cluster centre. Gas-
drag may cause the stellar system to contract enhancing the
effective sfe (Saiyadpour, Deiss & Kegel 1997). Thus, most of the
cluster is likely to be in virial equilibrium when the first massive
stars `ignite' with devastating effects for the residual (but still
mass-dominating) gas. This scenario is supported by various
observations which show star formation ongoing in a clustered
environment (e.g. Megeath et al. 1996).

 because observational evidence and theoretical arguments suggest that massive stars may form near cluster centres (Bonnell, Bate & Zinnecker 1998).

\subsection{Mass segregation in young compact star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud - I. Data and luminosity functions}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.331..228D/abstract

Although the standard picture, in which stars in dense clusters
evolve rapidly towards a state of energy equipartition through
stellar encounters, with the corresponding mass segregation, is
generally accepted, observations of various degrees of mass
segregation in very young star clusters (e.g. Hillenbrand 1997;
Testi et al. 1997; Fischer et al. 1998; Hillenbrand & Hartmann
1998; Hillenbrand & Carpenter 2000) suggest that at least some of this effect is related to the process of star and star cluster formation
itself (cf. Paper II). These clusters are often significantly younger
than their two-body relaxation time (even the equivalent relaxation
time in the core), the time-scale on which dynamical mass
segregation should occur. Quantifying the degree of actual mass
segregation is thus crucial for the interpretation of observational
LFs in terms of the IMF, even for very young star cluster .
Although dynamical two-body relaxation effects tend to
segregate the mass distribution of a cluster roughly on its mean
relaxation time-scale, possibly enhanced by some degree of
primordial mass segregation, the observability of mass segregation
depends on a number of conditions. These are mostly interrelated
and include, among others, the degree of central concentration of
the cluster, its age, the radial range sampled by the observations
and, most of all, the observer’s ability to resolve the individual
cluster stars towards the cluster centre.

Ground-based observations may be severely
hampered by crowding in the cluster cores, thus hiding possible
signatures of dynamical, as well as primordial, mass segregation.
This is probably the case in a number of the young star clusters in
the LMC studied by Elson, Fall & Freeman (1987) and
Subramaniam, Sagar & Bhatt (1993), 

Ground-based observations of both NGC 2024 (Lada et al. 1991;
Carpenter et al. 1997) and the Monoceros R2 (MonR2) complex
(Carpenter et al. 1997) have not been able to show the presence or
absence of (possibly primordial) mass segregation convincingly.
While Lada et al. (1991) suggested that the brighter stars in NGC
2024 seem to be more centrally concentrated than the fainter
cluster members, this evidence was deemed inconclusive by
Carpenter et al. (1997). 

A variety of techniques have revealed a significant
overabundance of high-mass stars in its very centre, and thus
strong mass segregation (e.g. Campbell et al. 1992; Larson 1993;
Malumuth & Heap 1994; Brandl et al. 1996). Hunter et al. (1995)
constrained the central region in which possible mass segregation
effects were observed to r & 0:5 pc, and found little evidence of
mass segregation beyond this radius for stars in the mass range
2:8 # m # 15 M(. However, they reported a hint of an excess of
bright stars within 0.5 pc, and a deficit of the highest-mass stars in
the annulus 0:6 # r # 1:2 pc, which would be consistent with
expectations for mass segregation. Brandl, Chernoff & Moffat
(2001), finally, present very interesting evidence for the ejection of
a fair number of massive stars from the core, owing to two-body
encounters, which could not, with higher confidence, be attributed
to alternative scenarios

Thus, in most of the young compact star clusters that can be
resolved in individual stars by currently available telescopes, mass
segregation effects are observed, although to varying degrees. This
underlines the importance of our understanding of the physical
processes involved in the formation and evolution of star clusters,
and in particular of the IMF, which will ultimately determine
whether a young star cluster will eventually be destroyed or evolve
into a Galactic GC-type object.

\subsection{Mass segregation in young compact star clusters in the Large Magellanic
Cloud – II. Mass functions}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.331..245D/abstract

Consequently, the high-mass stars will gradually sink towards
the bottom of the cluster potential, i.e. the cluster centre (cf. Spitzer
& Hart 1971), with the highest-mass stars and those closest to the
cluster centre sinking the fastest, although this process is not
negligible even at the edge of the cluster (e.g. Chernoff &
Weinberg 1990; Hunter et al. 1995). 

The time-scale for the onset of significant dynamical mass
segregation is comparable to the dynamical relaxation time of the
cluster (Spitzer & Shull 1975; Inagaki & Saslaw 1985; Bonnell &
Davies 1998; Elson et al. 1998). The characteristic time-scale of a
cluster may be taken to be its half-mass (or median) relaxation
time, i.e. the relaxation time at the mean density for the inner half
of the cluster mass for cluster stars with stellar velocity dispersions
characteristic for the cluster as a whole (Spitzer & Hart 1971;
Lightman & Shapiro 1978; Meylan 1987; Malumuth & Heap 1994;
Brandl et al. 1996), and can be written as (Meylan 1987)

t_rh = ecuacion del paper

Although the half-mass relaxation time characterizes the
dynamical evolution of a cluster as a whole, significant differences
are expected locally within the cluster. From equation (1) it follows
immediately that the relaxation time-scale will be shorter for
higher-mass stars (greater kml) than for their lower-mass
companions; numerical simulations of realistic clusters confirm
this picture (e.g. Aarseth & Heggie 1998, see also Hunter et al.
1995; Kontizas et al. 1998). From this argument it follows that
dynamical mass segregation will also be most rapid where the local
relaxation time is shortest, i.e. near the cluster centre (cf. Fischer
et al. 1998; Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998). The relaxation time in
the core can be written as (Meylan 1987)
tr;0 ¼ð1:55 £ 107Þ vsR2
core
km0llogð0:5Mtot/kmlÞyr; ð2Þ
where Rcore is the cluster core radius (in pc), vs (km s21) is the
velocity scale and km0l is the mean mass (in M() of all particles in
thermal equilibrium in the central parts.

Thus, significant mass segregation among the most massive stars
in the cluster core occurs on the local, central relaxation time-scale
(comparable to just a few crossing times, cf. Bonnell & Davies
1998), whereas a time-scale /tr,h is required to affect a large
fraction of the cluster mass.

In addition, as the more massive stars move inwards towards the
cluster centre, their dynamical evolution will speed up, and hence the
dynamical relaxation time-scale for a specific massive species is
hard to define properly

1.2 Primordial mass segregation:
Although a cluster will have lost all traces of its initial conditions. on time-scales longer than its characteristic relaxation time, on
shorter time-scales the observed stellar density distribution is likely
to be the result of dynamical relaxation and of the way that star
formation has taken place. The process is, in fact, more compli-
cated, as the high-mass stars evolve on the same time-scale as the
lower-mass stars (cf. Aarseth 1999). In order to understand the
process of mass segregation in a cluster in detail, we have to get an
idea of the amount of ‘primordial’ mass segregation in the cluster.
The nature and degree of primordial mass segregation is
presumably determined by the properties of interactions of proto-
stellar material during the star-forming episode in a cluster. In the
classic picture of star formation (Shu, Adams & Lizano 1987),
interactions are unimportant and mass segregation does not occur.
However, Fischer et al. (1998) conclude that their observations of
NGC 2157 seem to indicate the picture in which encounters at the
early stages in the evolution enhance mass accretion of the cluster
caused by the merging of protostellar clumps until the mass of
these clumps exceeds the initial mass of a star to be formed. More
massive stars are subject to more mergers and hence accrete even
more mass (cf. Larson 1991; Bonnell et al. 2001a,b and references
therein), and therefore dissipate more kinetic energy. In addition,
they tend to form near the cluster centre, in the highest-density
region, where the encounter rate is highest (cf. Larson 1991;
Bonnell et al. 1997, 2001a,b; Bonnell, Bate & Zinnecker 1998;
Bonnell & Davies 1998).

\subsection{LISC Catalog of Open Clusters III. 83 Newly Found Galactic Disk Open Clusters Using Gaia EDR3}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023RAA....23f5008C/abstract
An open cluster (OC) is a star cluster in which all member
stars are gravitationally bound to each other. In the Milky Way,
most of such clusters are found in the disk region. Their
formation is thought to be related to the structure of the Galaxy.
The stars of an OC usually form in the same molecular cloud
and therefore have approximately the same age and metallicity.
Thus the member stars of an OC distribute on an isochrone in
the color–magnitude diagram (CMD). This can supply some
clues to the studies of the evolution of stars. Therefore, it is
essential to nd OCs in the Galaxy and study their stellar
properties in detail.

of star clusters in the central region of the Small Magellanic Cloud}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...681A..24S/abstract

The detection of star clusters is not as straightforward
as it might seem, especially when considering relatively low number-density clusters projected on a dense and variable back-
ground. This means that the spatial resolution of the data that are
used is a crucial factor, particularly when the cluster identifica-
tion is based only on projected spatial overdensities. Identified
star cluster candidates were frequently later discarded as false
detections when better-quality (resolution) data became avail-
able. 

Many authors have applied several diﬀerent methods and cri-
teria. Machine-learning approaches are the most recent addition.
Schmeja (2011) compared four diﬀerent methods of identifying
stellar number-density enhancements in a field. The computation
time of each algorithm was diﬀerent and depended on the size,
the properties of the area under investigation, and the purpose of
the study. Bitsakis et al. (2018) followed an automated detection
method and found a large number of new candidate clusters in
the central regions of the SMC, the great majority of which were
later disputed or classified as stellar associations (Piatti 2018;
Bica et al. 2020)

\subsection{Tracing the Origins of Mass Segregation in M35: Evidence for Primordially Segregated
Binaries
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...962L...9M/abstract

Open clusters (OCs) provide an important laboratory for
studying dynamical evolution and mass segregation, given their
typically extensive amount of stellar multiplicity and the
homogeneity of stellar properties such as age, distance,
metallicity, reddening, etc. in a given cluster. Through two-
body relaxation and other processes leading to energy
exchange between stars and binaries, star clusters are expected
to become (dynamically) mass segregated, where the more
massive objects in the cluster occupy a more centrally
concentrated spatial distribution than the lighter objects
(King 1962; Giersz & Heggie 1997). For a given mass range
in (primary) stars, binaries are expected to be more massive
than the single stars (since binaries contain two stars), and
therefore the expectation for relaxed clusters is that binaries
will be mass segregated with respect to single stars.
Furthermore, binary systems offer signi cant insight into the
dynamical evolution of OCs as most gravitational encounters in
OCs are expected to be infuenced by binaries, and can lead to
direct collisions, mergers, mass transfer, and energy exchanges
(e.g., Fregeau et al. 2004; Leigh & Sills 2011; de Grijs et al.
2017).
The dynamical states and evolution of young clusters are of
particular interest, as they are expected to retain their near-birth
(primordial) conditions. Searching for mass segregation in the youngest clusters can address the question of whether mass
segregation may be primordial or largely attributed to
dynamical and relaxation processes. Some of the youngest
clusters that have been studied observationally for mass
segregation include NGC 2264 (3 Myr; Nony et al. 2021),
NGC 6231 (3–4 Myr; Raboud & Mermilliod 1998), IC 1590
(3.5–4.4 Myr; Kim et al. 2021), NGC 2516 (100 Myr; Pera
et al. 2022), and the Hyades (680 Myr; Evans & Oh 2022).
NGC 2264, NGC 6231, IC 1590, and NGC 2516 all show
evidence of primordial mass segregation. Each of these clusters
also has relaxation times that are  the cluster age. In particular
for NGC 6231, Raboud & Mermilliod (1998) concluded that
binaries (and other multiple systems) are more centrally
concentrated than single stars, likely as a result of stellar
formation processes and not through dynamical means. In
contrast, Raboud & Mermilliod (1998) nd the Hyades to
contain a highly mass segregated stellar population as a result
of dynamical relaxation. This may be due to the Hyades having
already undergone∼10 relaxation times. At an age of
∼130–200 Myr (McNamara & Sekiguchi 1986; Braden et al.
2008; Geller et al. 2010; McNamara et al. 2011; Leiner et al.
2015), M35 lies in between these previously studied clusters.
Numerical simulations of similar young clusters have also
been used to study the origin of mass segregation. Bonnell &
Davies (1998) found within their simulations that the most
massive members of a young OC most likely formed in the
center of that cluster. Pavlík (2020) concluded that binaries lead
to quicker dynamical evolution for an OC like the Orion
Nebula Cluster (ONC). Clusters with initially larger binary
fractions evolve more quickly due to the influence of massive
binaries (and even more so by hard binaries). The study also
nds that the ONC was likely primordially mass segregated.
Converse & Stahler (2010) determined through a simulation
that the Pleiades was also initially mass segregated.

\subsection{Berkeley 76: An intermediate age open star cluster in Gaia Era}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024NewA..10902205B/abstract

An open cluster (OC) contains a few hundred to a few thousand
stars originating from a single massive molecular cloud (Corsaro et al.,
2017). These stars are loosely connected through weak gravitational
forces (Leroy et al., 2018). OCs have a diffuse morphology in contrast
to globular clusters, which are tightly bound by gravity and contain
hundreds of thousands to millions of stars (Stevenson, 2015). Their
member stars may disperse after a few million years (Holtzman et al.,
1992). One possible reason is the gravitational interactions with other
objects in their surroundings, such as giant molecular clouds (Clark
et al., 2005). OCs are mainly found in star-forming spiral and ir-
regular galaxies rather than in elliptical galaxies with no new star
formation. Young OCs form from the gas and dust in star-forming
regions, mainly in the spiral and irregular galaxies (Hunter, 1997).
The main fundamental parameters of star clusters, such as distances,
ages, and color excess, are critical in understanding the structure and
evolution of the Milky Way (Spina et al., 2021). To generate reliable
results, existing open-cluster inventories collect all the necessary data
to determine standardized open-cluster parameters. This data is critical
in understanding the properties and characteristics of OCs, such as their
ages, masses, and spatial distributions (Bisht et al., 2022).

\subsection{Gaia (DR3)-based astronomical analysis of the seven unstudied open star
clusters} 

Open clusters (OCs) are helpful probes to better understand the
structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Those found near the Galac-
tic plane, are significantly younger and have more metal-rich stars than
globular clusters found near the halo of the Galaxy. OCs are collections
of stars with the same physical characteristics. These stars are created
simultaneously by a molecular cloud. The interest in these systems can
be explained by using astrometric and photometric data, (Dias et al.,
2021). Since clusters’ stars are initially gravitationally connected, they
have similar positional and kinematic properties. Therefore, OCs can be
used to examine the history of star evolution in the Galaxy and aids in
the comprehension of star formation and dynamics (Bate et al., 2003;
Harris and Pudritz, 1994; Lada and Lada, 2003; Portegies Zwart et al.,
2010).

For more than 1.3 billion sources, the third Gaia data release (Gaia
DR3) offers precise five-parameter astrometric data (positions, proper
motions, and parallaxes). Gaia DR3 will demonstrate how well these
data can be utilized to identify cluster members, particularly in high-
density areas, and it is quite successful. Over the years, OCs are crucial
and frequently utilized to comprehend different aspects of the Galactic
disc, such as the Milky Way’s spiral arms, (Bonatto et al., 2006).

The study of OCs has advanced quickly in harmony with the many
Gaia mission data releases, (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2016). The major
advancement came with Gaia DR2, (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2018),
which allowed for the first homogeneous study of the OCs census
while taking advantage of Gaia’s all-sky capabilities and the precise sky
positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry in three different
bands for sources numbering in the billions. 

Using these data, Cantat-Gaudin (2018) were able to characterize
over one thousand OCs in our Galaxy, providing accurate membership
lists and mean astrometric parameters for them, and classify some ob-
jects present in pre-Gaia catalogs (Dias et al., 2002; Kharchenko et al.,
2013) as asterisms. Additionally, finding of hundreds of additional
objects increased the number of known OCs. Castro-Ginard et al. (2018)
systematically analyzed the Galactic disc, searching for new OCs based
on the clustering of stars in the five-dimensional astrometric space, and
then confirmed them as real objects in Gaia photometry. This analysis
was made possible by novel machine-learning techniques and a Big
Data environment, (Castro-Ginard et al., 2019, 2020, 2021).

On the other hand, comparing Gaia and 2MASS (Two Micron All-
Sky Survey), they are both astronomical surveys that valuable data
about celestial objects, there are some key differences between them.

Gaia is a mission by the European Agency (ESA) designed to create
a precise three-dimensional map of our Milky Way Galaxy. It aims to
measure the positions, distances, motions, and other properties of over
a billion stars in our Galaxy.1
Gaia DR3 refers to the third data release from the Gaia mission in
optical wavelengths, covering a range of about 330 to 1050 nanome-
ters, (Akhmetov et al., 2021). It includes information on other celestial
objects such as asteroids, quasars, and galaxies. The data is made avail-
able through the Gaia Archive, where users can access and analyze the
data using the Gaia Data Release Documentation and perform queries
using the Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL). On the other
hand, 2MASS is a ground-based survey that focused on photometry and
involves measuring the brightness and colors of objects in the near-
infrared wavelengths (specifically, at 1.25, 1.65, and 2.17 microns),
which allows it to penetrate dust and provide valuable information
about cooler and more obscured objects. Its primary goal was to cata-
logue and study objects such as stars, galaxies, and other astronomical
sources.2 Although Gaia has a much higher spatial resolution compared
to 2MASS, most of the investigated clusters here lie in very low-dense
fields, so 2MASS dataset photometry has been used

The search for new star clusters in the Milky Way (MW) is
revealing ever more suitable candidates, especially in those
regions heavily aﬀected by diﬀerential reddening and crowd-
ing, such as the Galactic plane and bulge. In this context, 37
recently analysed globular clusters (GCs) have been listed in
the compilation made by Bica et al. (2024); Garro et al. (2024,
and references therein), or numerous open cluster (OC) candi-
dates (see e.g. Castro-Ginard et al. 2022; Hao et al. 2022, among
others), making a significant step forward in our understanding of the MW structure and evolution. This eﬀort holds tremen-
dous potential for several reasons. The first is the completion of
the Galactic GC (Minniti et al. 2017) and OC (Hunt & Reﬀert
2024) census. For instance, with thorough spectroscopic follow-
ups, new GCs could contribute to a potential increase of 20%
(or more) in the total number of known MW GCs in the com-
ing years. The second is exploring the dissolution and destruc-
tion of a GC and OC (Gnedin & Ostriker 1997; Baumgardt et al.
2008; Brockamp et al. 2014). Given their faint nature, these clus-
ters likely lost stars over their lifetimes. However, the extent
of this loss and the processes involved, including the formation of tidal tails, remain unclear. Additionally, comprehending the
processes of mass loss can provide insights into the potential
links between stars lost by clusters and field stars, shedding light
on the nature and extent of this connection (Kruijssen 2012;
Adamo et al. 2015). The third reason is for investigating the ori-
gin and formation of GCs. By distinguishing between in situ or
ex situ formation scenarios (Recio-Blanco 2018; Massari et al.
2019; Belokurov & Kravtsov 2023; Shirazi et al. 2023), we can
uncover whether these clusters were accreted or formed dur-
ing the early stages of MW formation. Additionally, they shed
light on processes, such as wet mergers, that contribute gas
to our Galaxy and that potentially lead to the formation of
a second generation of cluster population (Calura et al. 2019;
Yaghoobi et al. 2021). Fourth, we need to understand how to dis-
tinguish old OCs from young GCs since there is no clear separa-
tion between these two classes. Finally, as shown in Garro et al.
(2024), increasing the number of MW GCs can help us to under-
stand the formation and evolution of the MW itself, upgrading
the luminosity function, age, and metallicity distributions, and
other tools used to study our Galaxy.

We wanted to ascertain whether the identified overdensity holds
the characteristics of a genuine star cluster or if it might be a
mere grouping of stars or statistical fluctuations in the projected
stellar density within the plane of the sky, which were leading
us astray.

\subsection{Goodbye to Chi by Eye: A Bayesian Analysis of Photometric Binaries in Six Open Clusters}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...962...41C/abstract

Binary and higher-order multiple stars are ubiquitous and
comprise a large fraction of the stars in star-forming regions
(Ghez et al. 1993; Köhler et al. 2000; Kraus et al. 2011;
Bate 2012; Sana et al. 2013), open clusters (OCs; Mermilliod
et al. 1992; Patience et al. 1998, 2002; Geller et al. 2008, 2010;
Hole et al. 2009) and the Galactic eld (Raghavan et al. 2010;
Moe & Di Stefano 2017). The multiplicity fraction for solar-
type stars in the Galactic eld is approximately 50%, and
increases to 70% for the most massive stars (Raghavan et al.
2010; Sana et al. 2012; Duchêne & Kraus 2013; Caballero-
Nieves et al. 2014). The binary fraction4 (excluding higher-
order multiples) for solar-type stars in the eld is 34% ± 2%
(Raghavan et al. 2010). Despite their universality, work
remains to understand the extent to which the birth environ-
ment affects the primordial binary frequency and global
distributions of orbital parameters and mass ratios, and how
these primordial characteristics are modi ed by dynamical
processes within star clusters.
Binaries in the Galactic eld are found essentially in
isolation; only the widest eld binaries (those with separations over ∼103 au) are in danger of encountering passing stars, or
having their orbits changed dramatically by the Galactic tidal
eld (Kaib & Raymond 2014). However, most stars with
masses 0.5 Me form in denser environments and later get
dispersed into the eld (Lada & Lada 2003; Evans et al. 2009;
Bressert et al. 2010). Some stars are subjected to gigayears of
dynamical perturbations from their neighbors within star
clusters. Though many OCs dissolve to populate the Galactic
eld (Adams & Myers 2001), close stellar encounters within
these birth environments can signi cantly modify, and even
disrupt, binary systems that would otherwise be stable in the
Galactic field.

Therefore, our interpretation of the observed binary popula-
tions in star clusters and the eld, as well as our understanding
of star formation, relies on how a population of stars and
binaries evolves through this more dynamically active stage in
a star cluster. Yet we have precious little empirical data on star
cluster binary properties.
Sophisticated N-body modeling provides predictions for the
evolution of a binary population in a star cluster (e.g., Portegies
Zwart et al. 2001; Hurley et al. 2005; Marks et al. 2011; Geller
et al. 2013a, 2013b, 2015a). Such simulations model the
gravitational interactions and stellar (and binary) evolution
processes for each star over gigayear timescales. They predict
that the binary fraction in a star cluster will be modi ed over
time by both distant two-body relaxation effects and close
encounters with other single stars and stellar systems (e.g.,
Geller et al. 2013a, 2015a). For instance, the effects of two-
body relaxation leading to mass segregation are predicted to
raise the main-sequence (MS) binary fraction in the cluster core relative to the cluster halo over time (Cote et al. 1991; Layden
et al. 1999; Fregeau et al. 2002). Also, close stellar encounters
are predicted to truncate the distribution of orbital separations
(or periods) at the“hard–soft” boundary (e.g., Heggie 1975;
Geller et al. 2013b), possibly resulting in higher-mass clusters
(which generally have higher velocity dispersions) having
lower binary fractions. Stellar encounters are also expected to
modify the mass-ratio distribution of a binary population
(Marks et al. 2011; Geller et al. 2013b), for instance through
exchanges leading to a mass-ratio distribution biased toward
higher mass ratios.

Unresolved binaries can be identi ed photometrically based
on their location on a color–magnitude diagram (CMD). Binary
stars appear redder in color and brighter than a single star with
the same primary mass (Hurley & Tout 1998). Indeed,
photometric binary studies have been carried out in a sample
of Galactic globular clusters (GCs; Milone et al. 2012), and a
handful of OCs (Frinchaboy & Thompson 2015; Cohen et al.
2020; Jadhav et al. 2021; Cordoni et al. 2023).

\subsection{MASS SEGREGATION IN VERY YOUNG OPEN CLUSTERS:
A CASE STUDY OF NGC 2244 AND NGC 6530}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....134.1368C/abstract


Open clusters are considered excellent laboratories for studies
of stellar evolution and the dynamics of stellar systems. A large
fraction of Galactic open clusters are situated close to the Galactic
plane, thus potentially making them appropriate objects for prob-
ing the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk, although the
presence of dust in the Galactic plane restricts their usefulness in
this sense.
One of many important aspects in open cluster studies is related
to the effects of mass segregation; that is, the more massive mem-
ber stars in the cluster will be more centrally concentrated and/or
have a distinct distribution in velocity space compared to the lower
mass members. The key observational questions of interest in open
star cluster research include whether or not mass segregation exists
in a given star cluster and, if so, what the extent of this effect is in
relation to the cluster’s age. For cluster samples as a whole, the
similarities and differences of the effects of mass segregation for
clusters of various ages, abundances, and galactocentric distances
are of great interest. All of these properties are related to the for-
mation process, as well as the dynamical evolution of clusters.
They are also (sometimes significantly) influenced by the Galactic
tidal fields, in particular in the outer regions of a given cluster.
Young open clusters are important stellar systems for our under-
standing of the star formation process. In very young clusters, most
of the low-mass stars will still be in their pre-main-sequence (PMS)
evolutionary stage, and one may expect to derive global stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) that are not yet significantly affected
by stellar and dynamical evolution. However, if a significant amount
of ‘‘primordial’’ mass segregation (i.e., mass segregation intrinsic
to the star formation process itself ) is present, this would seriously
complicate the interpretation of an observed stellar luminosity
function ( LF ) at a given position within a star cluster in terms
of its IMF (de Grijs et al. 2002a, 2002b).

\subsection{Diagnosing the Stellar Population and Tidal Structure of the Blanco 1 Star Cluster}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889...99Z/abstract

Star formation takes place in dense molecular clouds. While
individual stars are formed in dense cores, collectively a giant
molecular cloud produces a complex of star clusters (Lada &
Lada 2003). The shape of a star cluster bears the imprint of its
formation and evolutionary history. At birth the stellar
distribution inherits the generally lamentary structure of the
parental molecular cloud (Chen et al. 2004). Thereafter,
through mutual gravitational interaction between member stars,
higher-mass stars lose kinetic energy and sink to the center,
whereas lower-mass members gain speed, thereby occupying a
progressively larger volume of space. Those low-mass
members at the outermost region are vulnerable to external
forces, e.g., the differential rotation, disk shocks, spiral arm
passage, etc., leading to tidal structures containing escaping
members.

It has been challenging to recognize such tidal tails for open
clusters because of the dif culty in distinguishing members in
the tails from eld stars. However, with the Gaia data release
2
(DR2) availing high-precision photometry, proper motion
(PM), and parallax data, detection of tidal tails in open clusters
in the solar neighborhood has been mushrooming (Hyades:
Meingast & Alves 2019; Röser et al. 2019, Coma Berenices:
Fürnkranz et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2019, Praesepe: Röser &
Schilbach 2019). These clusters are all relatively old,
∼600–800Myr (Röser et al. 2019; Röser & Schilbach 2019;
Tang et al. 2019), and located away from the Galactic Plane
(Hyades:

−20° . 6883, Coma Berenices:

+83° . 7630, and Praesepe:

detected and characterized.

\subsection{New Insights into the Structure of Open Clusters in the Gaia Era}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...54Z/abstract

The structural composition and the boundary of open
clusters have great signi cance in the study of open clusters,
which directly affect the measurement results of other
parameters such as the mass function, binary fraction, mass
ratio distribution, evolution timescale, and dynamic mass of
open clusters. It also affects our understanding of the
formation, evolution, and dissolution of star clusters.
As early as the early 20th century, Shapley (1916) and
Trümpler (1918) speculated that the generally observed open
star cluster may only be its high-density core component, and
there may be external low-density halo/corona components in
its outer region. Although the density of member stars in the
outer region is very low, as the scale is 5–10 times larger than
that of the core region, the total number of member stars may
still be several times or even 10 times larger than those in the
core region (Kholopov 1969).
In general, the traditional boundary (core area) of open
clusters is a location where the density of member stars is
approximately equal to that of background eld stars (r2;
Kharchenko et al. 2013, hereafter K13), while eld stars are
dominant beyond this region. In observation, because the
number density of member stars in the outer region is
signi cantly lower than that of the background eld star, it is
dif cult to effectively distinguish the member stars from the
eld stars without additional information. This also means that
high-precision kinematic data are of key importance to identify
member stars, especially in the outer region.

Fortunately, Gaia data provide us with high-precision
astrometric data, which also means one can obtain highly
reliable results of membership identi cation for further study-
ing cluster properties, such as the extended structure of clusters.
With the help of Gaia data, many tidal structures of old open
clusters have been discovered: Röser et al. (2019) and Meingast
& Alves (2019) con rmed the existence of a huge tidal
structure of more than 170 pc in Hyades for the rst time; based
on similar methods, Röser & Schilbach (2019) further studied
Praesepe and found that the cluster has a tidal tail structure of
165 pc; Carrera et al. (2019) also found that there is a tidal
structure of more than 50 pc around the famous cluster M67;
Zhang et al. (2020) found that the younger cluster Blanco_1
also has an extensional structure of more than 50 pc; Yeh et al.
(2019) investigated the dynamical status of the nearby cluster
Rupecht_147 and found the existence of prominent tidal tails as
well as an extended corona; in addition, Bai et al. (2022)
reported an elongated tail structure of the newly discovered
open cluster COIN-Gaia 13, with a total length of about 270 pc.

Using Gaia data, Zhong et al. (2019) investigate member
stars of young double clusters NGC_869 and NGC_884 within
a radius of 7° . 5. It is found that there is an obvious outer halo
structure, which is mainly distributed in a radius of 50 pc. This
discovery con rms for the rst time that very young clusters
also have an extended structure. The newly discovered outer
halo region is 6–8 times larger than the traditional boundary
(r2) de ned by K13. This study also shows that, with the help
of Gaia Data Release (DR) 2, the extended outer halo structure
of clusters within a distance of about 2 kpc can be well
distinguished from the background eld stars.

Although outer halo (or corona) structures and tidal tails
have been con rmed in the extended region of the open
clusters, the two structures have different characteristics and origins from the perspective of cluster dynamic evolution. [here refer marco teorico].

\subsection{A Gaia EDR3 search for tidal tails in disintegrating open clusters}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3525B/abstract


All stars likely form in clusters, which, over time, disintegrate to make
up the field population of the Galaxy (Portegies Zwart, McMillan &
Gieles 2010). Two-body relaxation over time leads to more-massive
stars sinking to the central regions of the cluster while less-massive
stars occupy a larger volume and gradually evaporate. Additionally,
the Galactic potential perturbs clusters to form tidal tails, an effect
observed for both open (e.g. Berkeley 17 - Chen, Chen & Shu 2004;
NGC 6791 - Dalessandro et al. 2015; Bhattacharya et al. 2017b)
and globular clusters (e.g. Palomar 5 - Odenkirchen et al. 2001;
NGC 5466 - Belokurov et al. 2006).
Identification of such tidal features in open clusters, which are
more abundant in the Galactic disc, has long been challenging from
photometric observations alone, despite the use of novel techniques
(e.g. Bhattacharya et al. 2017a). This is because low-density features
such as tidal tails are difficult to identify against the strong field
contamination in the Galactic disc. Reliable astrometry [proper
motion (PM) and parallax] from Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2;
Gaia Collaboration 2018) and recently Gaia Early Data Release 3
(Gaia EDR3; Gaia Collaboration 2021) has allowed for improved
field-star decontamination of many nearby open clusters, resulting
in the recent discovery of a many open clusters with extended stellar
coronae (e.g. Carrera et al. 2019; Meingast, Alves & Rottensteiner
2021; Tarricq et al. 2022), as well as 13 of those with tidal tails –
Hyades: R¨
oser, Schilbach & Goldman (2019), Meingast & Alves
(2019), Jerabkova et al. (2021); Coma Berenices: Tang et al. (2019);
Ruprecht 147: Yeh et al. (2019); Praesepe: R¨
oser & Schilbach (2019);
NGC 2506: Gao (2020b); Blanco 1: Zhang et al. (2020); M 67:
Gao (2020a); UBC 274: Castro-Ginard et al. (2020); Alpha Persei:
Nikiforova et al. (2020); NGC 2516, NGC 6633: Pang et al. (2021);
NGC 752: Bhattacharya et al. (2021a); Pleiades: Li, Pang & Tang
(2021). Tarricq et al. (2022) recently carried out a systematic search
for tidal tails in open clusters by identifying elongated features in the
2D projected spatial distribution of cluster members identified from
Gaia EDR3 data. While they identified elongated features in 72 open
clusters, terming them as tidal tails, they did not check the alignment
of these extended features with the cluster orbit direction.

\subsection{Deciphering Star Cluster Evolution by Shape Morphology}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912....5H/abstract



Stars form in groups out of molecular clouds (e.g., Lada &
Lada 2003; Alves & Bouy 2012; Megeath et al. 2016). The
youngest groups are distributed collectively as imprints of the
usual lamentary cloud structures. Once surplus gas and
dust has been dispersed (e.g., Tutukov 1978; Hills 1980;
Elmegreen 1983; Mathieu 1983; Adams 2000; Kroupa et al.
2001; Kroupa 2002; Goodwin & Bastian 2006; Moeckel &
Bate 2010; Pelupessy & Portegies Zwart 2012; Brinkmann
et al. 2017), two-body gravitational relaxation (e.g., Bergond
et al. 2001; Ryon et al. 2017; Mamon et al. 2019) among stellar
members leads to sphericalization, i.e., an overall circular
shape, with lower-mass members occupying larger volumes
(“mass segregation”). The least-massive members are most
vulnerable to dynamic ejection from the system (“stellar
evaporation”), further loosening the gravitational binding
(e.g., Gieles & Baumgardt 2008; Tang et al. 2019). External
perturbation such as tidal forces, differential rotation, or disk
crossing, exacerbates the disintegration process, and eventually
the members would supply as Galactic eld stars. The remnant
systems, globular, or open clusters we see today, with relatively
well-determined distances, ages, and metallicities, serve to
diagnose how stars of different masses evolve, and act as
laboratories to test stellar dynamics theories.
Open clusters, in particular, with dozens to thousands of
member stars each (Bergond et al. 2001), ages from millions to
billions of years old, and located in the Galactic disk, provide a
sample to probe Galactic structure and evolution (Balaguer-Núñez
et al. 2020). Most star groups are likely dispersed upon emergence
from molecular clouds (Lada & Lada 2003), and the majority of
the surviving star clusters are expected to be dissolved in some
108 yr (e.g., Wielen 1971; Pandey & Mahra 1986; Bergond et al.
2001; Bonatto et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2013). Conceivably,
longevity is possible only among systems relatively free of
disturbances.
The dynamical evolution of an open cluster, arising from
internal or external in uences, manifests itself in its shape
changes. As early as over a century ago, the attening of a moving
cluster was reasoned (Jeans 1916), and such a phenomenon was
indeed detected in the Hyades (Oort 1979). Pandey et al. (1990)
identi ed the existence of“corona” features around open clusters.
Such halo structures were characterized by Nilakshi et al. (2002)
based on the photometric data of the Digital Sky Survey. Bergond
et al. (2001) found open clusters to be generally elongated in a
direction parallel to the plane, attributed to tidal forces. Chen et al.
(2004), with a sample of 31 open clusters from the Two Micron
All Sky Survey (2MASS) data set, found clusters to be elongated
even among the youngest systems, re ecting morphological relics
in the parental molecular clouds; namely, young open clusters
inherit the shape of the dense molecular cloud from which they
formed (Getman et al. 2018). With the all-sky data of the
compiled catalog of 2.5 million stars (ASCC-2.5), Kharchenko
et al. (2009) derived the shape parameters, that is, the apparent
ellipticity and orientation of the ellipse, of 650 open clusters and
concluded that the ellipticities of open clusters generally range
from 0.2 to 0.3, which are lower than those of modeled clusters.
Zhai et al. (2017) computed the morphology parameters of 154
open clusters using the WEBDA database and suggested that all
clusters in their sample are elongated in shape. Bhattacharya et al.
(2017), by using probabilistic star counting of Pan-STARRS point
sources, detected the core–tail structure in the aged open cluster
Berkeley17, with the tails preferentially consisting of low-mass
members. With Gaia Data Release2 (DR2) data, the substructure
and halo of the double cluster h and χ Persei was diagnosed by
Zhong et al. (2019), Similarly, tidal tails are found in the nearby
clusters Coma Berenices (Tang et al. 2019) and Blanco1 (Zhang
et al. 2020). The expected avalanche of high-precision kinematic
and photometric data, particularly from Gaia, affords reliable
membership determination in, and hence the studies of the
dynamical evolution of, star clusters.

3.2. The Stratification Degree of Hierarchical Structure
The hierarchical structure of open clusters has been veri ed
(e.g., Raboud & Mermilliod 1998a, 1998b; Chen et al. 2004).

The left panel of Figure 9 also shows that the young clusters
are mainly distributed near the disk, and their tangential
strati cation covers almost the entire vertical axis. Open
clusters still embedded in their natal clouds are called
embedded clusters (Pelupessy & Portegies Zwart 2012). They
evolve into optically observed open clusters at the cost of
losing mass (called“infant losing weight”; Goodwin & Bastian 2006). It is important to note that these young clusters
are vulnerable to self-evolution and external forces. As a result,
they tend to exhibit a high degree of strati cation. Furthermore,

\subsection{A detection of the layered structure of nearby open clusters}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...672A..12H/abstract



A stellar system, usually an open cluster, mostly forming in
giant molecular clouds, is mainly located on the Galactic plane
(Lada & Lada 2003). There are two theories for the formation
of open clusters, one of which is the theory of monolithic clus-
ter formation (Lada et al. 1984). In this case, the cluster is first
born in the central, densest region of the molecular cloud. After
a violent expulsion of gas, the member stars in the dense clus-
ter expand and eventually disperse into the field (Lada & Lada
2003). The other theory is the mechanism of hierarchical star
formation (Kruijssen 2012). In this framework, star formation in
regions of high-density molecular clouds can produce gravita-
tionally bound clusters. Stellar groups that formed in low-density
regions have filamentary substructures that lose their bindings
soon after the residual gas is expelled. Regardless of the cluster
formation mechanism, it is inevitable that some imprints are left
on the morphology of open clusters. Therefore, the study of their
morphology can provide observational evidence of their forma-
tion mechanisms.

There have been many works on the morphology of
open clusters for several decades. (e.g., Bergond et al. 2001;
Nilakshi et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2004; Cartwright & Whitworth
2004; Santos et al. 2005; Kharchenko et al. 2009; Zhai et al.
2017; Dib et al. 2018; Hetem & Gregorio-Hetem 2019; Tarricq
et al. 2022). In some studies, the typical shapes presented in open
clusters are considered as core-corona structure (e.g., Chen et al.
2004; Zhai et al. 2017; Tarricq et al. 2022). Numerical simula-
tions performed by McMillan et al. (2007), Allison et al. (2009),
and Moeckel & Bonnell (2009) indicated that star clusters
form from the merging of substellar groups at a dynamically
subviral stage, which to some extent supports the hierarchical
star formation. Since the morphology of the merged subgroups
may have some correlation with the morphology of clusters, a
deeper study of the core-corona structure of clusters may verify
the cluster formation mechanism from observations.

At present, the core-corona structure of open clusters has
been studied in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
(3D) spaces in the form of single sources (Zhang et al. 2020;
Pang et al. 2021). However, there is a lack of statistical stud-
ies on the core-corona structure of open clusters, especially to
investigate the intrinsic morphological properties and laws of
the core-corona structure of open clusters.

\subsection{Detection of open cluster members inside and beyond tidal radius by machine learning methods based on Gaia DR3}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.532..622N/abstract

According to accepted theories, stars are born within a single
molecular cloud as a cluster. As a result, cluster members share
the same physical parameters and chemical elements. Additionally,
there exists an interaction between the Galaxy and clusters that
affects cluster formation and morphology. To gain a comprehensive
understanding of a cluster, including aspects such as the initial and
present mass function, cluster morphology, planet formation theories,
tidal tails, and interactions between galaxies and clusters, we must
identify not only members within the tidal radius but also those
outside it, such as cluster escape members (Friel 1995; de Bruijne
1999; Hoogerwerf & Aguilar 1999; Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn
2002).
Several theories have been proposed to describe the birth and
formation of stars within clusters, such as the hierarchical theory
(Kruijssen 2012) or the centred formation theory (Lada & Lada
2003). By studying the morphology of clusters in a wide field of
view, we can determine which theory is more accurate than the others
(Hu et al. 2023). Meanwhile, reliable cluster membership allows for
the determination of the mass distribution of stars and the fraction
of binary star systems within the cluster. This information can then
be compared with simulation methods, such as N-body simulations
(Ma´
ız Apell´ aniz 2019; Olivares et al. 2019; Almeida, Monteiro &
Dias 2023; Pauwels et al. 2023).
Extended stellar coronae and tidal tails play an important role in
the study of cluster formation, evolution, and interactions between
galaxies and clusters. To achieve this, we need to study clusters
across a wide field of view, covering distances of up to hundreds
of arcmin (Lodieu et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2019; Bhattacharya et al.
2021, 2022; Jerabkova et al. 2021; Meingast, Alves & Rottensteiner
2021; Ye et al. 2021; Tarricq et al. 2022; Hu et al. 2023). The first
and most crucial step in the study of star clusters is to identify
reliable members. To achieve this goal, we require accurate and
comprehensive data, along with methods that can work with these
data and yield robust results. Membership determination within a
star cluster occurs through two primary approaches: astrometric and
photometric parameters (Kraus & Hillenbrand 2007; Krone-Martins
et al. 2010; Kos et al. 2018; Gonz´ alez-D´
ıaz et al. 2019). Because stars
within clusters originate from a common interstellar cloud, they share
the same astronomical characteristics such as position, parallax, and
proper motion. Additionally, these stars show a clear main sequence
and, in the case of an old cluster, red giant branches.

at can identify relevant patterns within large data sets is machine
learning. To achieve high accuracy, machine learning algorithms
require data with high precision. The Gaia data release contains
information about billions of stars in our galaxy, with high-accuracy
astrometry and photometry parameters. Many studies have been
conducted using machine learning methods based on the Gaia data
release to identify members of star clusters, some of which are
mentioned here: Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018) used K-means and
unsupervised photometric membership assignment in stellar clusters
(UPMASK), Gao (2018a, b, c, 2019) used Gaussian mixture model
(GMM) and random forest, Wilkinson, Mer´

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...656A..49H/abstract

With ages ranging from millions to billions of years and typically
containing 102–104 stars, open clusters are irregular, dynami-
cally bound stellar systems located in the Galactic disk. The
properties of open cluster populations, such as metallicity, age,
and morphology, are useful tools in the study of their dynamic
evolution (Krumholz et al. 2019). Although the member stars
of cluster populations are diﬃcult to detect in full, particularly
with regard to fainter members, a great deal of eﬀort has been
made to compile a large catalog of members of open clusters
(e.g., Sampedro et al. 2017; Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018, 2020;
Castro-Ginard et al. 2019, 2020; Cantat-Gaudin & Anders 2020)
that would serve as a basis for statistical surveys of the shapes of
open clusters.
The morphology of open clusters can mostly be viewed as
a layered structure, namely, one containing a core and corona,
as confirmed by Kholopov (e.g., 1969); Raboud & Mermil-
liod (e.g., 1998); Chen et al. (e.g., 2004). This means that the
shapes of the coronas and central cores of open clusters dom-
inated by diﬀerent forces evolve in diﬀerent ways. As an open
cluster evolves, the distribution of member stars in its core is
altered by internal gravitational interactions among its mem-
ber stars. Subsequently, stellar evaporation and external distur-
bances, for instance, Galactic tidal force, diﬀerential rotation,
and encounters with molecular clouds, would aﬀect the exter-
nal spatial structure of the cluster and eventually dissolve it. In
light of the layered structure of open clusters

Open clusters, which are mainly distributed along the Galac-
tic plane, make up an important part of the Milky Way. As
a consequence, it is of great significance for the study of the
Milky Way, such as tracing the structures of the galactic spiral
arms (Dias & Lépine 2005). In the evolution of the open clus-
ters, the number of their members must change due to star evo-
lution (Portegies Zwart et al. 2010), collisional dynamics, and
tidal perturbations (Krause et al. 2020). Their shapes can visu-
ally indicate this change. In addition, the morphology of the
open clusters may inherit morphological imprints of their for-
mation period (Krause et al. 2020), which can allow us to follow
their formation mechanism. Therefore, the morphology of open
clusters plays a vital role in the formation and evolution of open
clusters. The typical shape presented in the clusters is thought to be
the core-corona structure (e.g., Artyukhina & Kholopov 1966;
Kholopov 1969; Chen et al. 2004; Zhai et al. 2017), referred to as
the layered structure in our previous study (Hu et al. 2023). 
As long as open clusters can survive in their embedded phase
(Lada & Lada 2003), the physical processes that may change the
morphology of the open clusters can be roughly described as fol-
lows. As a cluster evolves, the distribution of stellar members
in its core is likely modified by star evolution, mass segregation
(Vesperini et al. 2009; Portegies Zwart et al. 2010; Evans & Oh
2022; Noormohammadi et al. 2023), and internal gravitationalinteraction among its members. Subsequently, stellar evaporation
(Portegies Zwart et al. 2010; Reina-Campos et al. 2023), expan-
sion resulted from dynamical evolution (Krause et al. 2020), pos-
sible intrusion of non-native stars (Hu et al. 2022), and external
perturbations (Spitzer 1958; Portegies Zwart et al. 2010), for
instance, Galactic tidal stripping due to the Galactic poten-
tial (Heggie & Hut 2003; Ernst et al. 2015; McDivitt et al. 2022;
Angelo et al. 2023), Galactic diﬀerential rotation along with,
gravitational perturbations from giant molecular clouds, would
alter the spatial structure of its outer region. In the process above,
the internal and external morphologies of the open cluster will
gradually show diﬀerences. In this work we consider whether
such diﬀerences have an impact on cluster evolution and clus-
ter morphological stability. Numerous eﬀorts have been under-
taken to study the morphology of open clusters (e.g., Jeans
1916; Artyukhina & Kholopov 1966; Kholopov 1969; Oort 1979;
Pandey et al. 1990; Bergond et al. 2001; Nilakshi et al. 2002;
Chen et al. 2004; Cartwright & Whitworth 2004; Santos et al.
2005; Kharchenko et al. 2009; Zhai et al. 2017; Dib et al. 2018;
Hetem & Gregorio-Hetem 2019; Pang et al. 2021; Tarricq et al.
2022; Zhong et al. 2022); however, very few have studied the mor-
phological issue mentioned above due to the lack of parameters
to assess it. This has limited (to some extent) our comprehensive
and in-depth understanding and study of the open clusters.

\subsection{Young, wild, and free: The early expansion of star clusters}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...683A..10D/abstract


It is commonly accepted that most Galactic star formation takes
place in embedded protoclusters as a result of turbulent, clumpy,
and stochastic processes in molecular clouds (e.g., Lada & Lada
2003; Oﬀner et al. 2009; Feigelson et al. 2013). The environ-
ments in which stars form determine to some extent a number
of key properties that characterize the stellar clusters we observe
today, such as their initial mass function, the stellar multiplicity,
and the star-by-star chemical abundance diﬀerences routinely
observed in massive stellar clusters (e.g., Bastian & Lardo 2018;
Gratton et al. 2019; Milone & Marino 2022).
In recent years there has been renewed interest in the the-
oretical and observational study of the formation of stellar
clusters. Particular attention has been paid to the very early
evolutionary phases, when clusters are expected to undergo
violent relaxation and be evolving toward a virial equilib-
rium state. Studies of clusters’ formation and very early evo-
lution have shown that clusters can emerge from these evo-
lutionary phases with internal rotation, radial anisotropy in
the velocity distribution, and mass segregation. However, the
detailed role of the various physical processes involved and
the variety of diﬀerent dynamical paths are still a matter of
intense investigation (see, e.g., McMillan et al. 2007; Allison et al.
2009; Moeckel & Bonnell 2009; Pfalzner & Kaczmarek 2013;
Banerjee & Kroupa 2014; Vesperini et al. 2014; Fujii & Portegies
Zwart 2016; Parker et al. 2016; Domínguez et al. 2017; Mapelli
2017; Daﬀern-Powell & Parker 2020; González-Samaniego &
Vazquez-Semadeni 2020).
Furthermore, the clusters’ early evolutionary phases have
been only poorly constrained by observations, mainly due to
the diﬃculty of obtaining reliable kinematic information for
statistically significant samples of cluster members. Data from
the Gaia space mission, in particular its third data release (DR3;
Gaia Collaboration 2023), provided the deepest and most pre-
cise astrometric catalog ever obtained and made possible new
studies on star cluster formation and dynamics. Indeed, Gaia’s
unprecedented kinematical mapping of the Galaxy and of its
stellar components has significantly enriched our knowledge of
the number and properties of star clusters in the Milky Way
(see, e.g., Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2020; Cantat-Gaudin & Anders
2020). It has also enabled detailed studies of nearby star-forming
regions and their use as ideal laboratories to shed new light on
cluster formation and early evolution (e.g., Beccari et al. 2018;
Kuhn et al. 2019; Meingast & Alves 2019; Dalessandro et al.
2021; Della Croce et al. 2023).
The evolution of a young cluster depends on many phys-
ical factors, such as the cluster’s structural properties (e.g.,
mass and size), the strength of the external tidal fields, and
their physical and dynamical ages (see, e.g., Hills 1980;
Parker et al. 2014; Sills et al. 2018). Early cluster expansion
is expected to play a fundamental role in cluster evolu-
tion and drive stellar systems toward complete dissolution
(Elmegreen 1983; Mathieu 1983; Adams 2000; Kroupa 2001;
Goodwin & Bastian 2006; Pelupessy & Portegies Zwart 2012;
Dinnbier & Kroupa 2020; Dinnbier et al. 2022; Farias & Tan
2023). Theoretical studies show that cluster expansion due
to processes such as gas expulsion and the subsequent vio-
lent relaxation phase may last several megayears, depend-
ing on many cluster properties, including the cluster dynam-
ical state at the expulsion, the specific star-formation eﬃ-
ciency, and the cluster size, density, and mass (Kroupa et al.
2001; Baumgardt & Kroupa 2007; Pelupessy & Portegies Zwart
2012; Banerjee & Kroupa 2013; Pfalzner & Kaczmarek 2013;

\subsection{Stellar cores in the Sh 2-305 H ii region}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891...81P/abstract

It is believed that most of the stars form in some sorts of clusters or associations of various sizes and masses
within the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) (Lada & Lada 2003). Though the smallest groups are more frequent,
however about 70% - 90% of all young stars are found in embedded young clusters and groups that are found in the
largest clusters (Lada & Lada 2003; Allen et al. 2007; Grasha et al. 2017, 2018). This hierarchical distribution of
star clusters is governed by the fragmentation of the dense gas under the influence of gravitational collapse and/or
turbulence, dynamical motions of young stars, and other feedback processes. Hence, the distribution of embedded
clusters imprints the fractal structure of the GMCs from which they born (Efremov 1978; Scalo 1986; Elmegreen &
Falgarone 1996; S´anchez et al. 2010).

The feedback processes from the young massive stars also aﬀect the evolution of the young embedded clusters by
exhausting the remaining dust and gas, thus slowing down further star formation and the gravitational binding energy.
This feedback limits the star formation eﬃciency (SFE) and leaves many embedded clusters unbound, with their
member stars likely to disperse (Lada & Lada 2003; Fall et al. 2010; Krumholz et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2018). In our
Galaxy, the embedded-cluster phase lasts only 2-4 Myr and the vast majority of young star clusters (YSCs) which
form in molecular clouds dissolve within 10 Myr or less of their birth. This early mortality of YSCs is likely a result
of the low SFE that characterizes the massive molecular cloud cores within which the clusters form. Hence, observing
low to modest final SFEs are key to understand the early dynamical evolution and infant mortality as well as mass
distribution of member stars of such objects.

The application to open clusters is in turn more uncer-
tain because their dynamics is dominated by the tidal forces
of the Galaxy rather than by their internal potential. Nonethe-
less, Just et al. (2023) have computed tidal masses of 2227 clus-
ters, regardless of their nature. Of these, 505 are younger than
30 Myr, but only 149 star clusters are in common with the Gaia
sample we investigated. By comparing the masses of the com-
mon clusters, we found that the tidal approach yields masses
that are systematically lower than those based on star counts
used here. This behavior might be due to mass segregation
eﬀects (Portegies Zwart et al. 2010; Kirk & Myers 2011), induc-
ing smaller estimates of the cluster radius that might strongly
bias the results toward lower masses (Ernst et al. 2010).



\subsection{Mass and wind luminosity of young Galactic open clusters in Gaia DR2}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...686A.118C/abstract

Stellar clusters belonging to the disk of the Galaxy are usu-
ally referred to as open clusters. They consist of homogeneous
groups of stars with the same age and initial chemical com-
position. As star formation occurs primarily in clusters, they
constitute ideal laboratories for tracing the star formation and
evolution in our Galaxy (see Krumholz et al. 2019, for a recent
review). The dynamical evolution of clusters is a result of several
processes, including stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal
interactions, and shocks. During their lifetime, clusters tidally
interact with their parent giant molecular clouds and with the
Galactic structure. They eventually dissolve after a few relax-
ation times.

Therefore, we applied a selection criterion to the initial clus-
ter sample and only retained those younger than 30 Myr, which
roughly corresponds to the main-sequence (MS) lifetime of stars
with M ≃ 8 M⊙, that is, the minimum mass value for stellar
evolution to terminate with an SN explosion. This reduced the
number of considered clusters to 390.

The analysis of the extinction maps (Lallement et al. 2022) sug-
gests that clusters should be detectable up to 3 kpc, even though
there are directions in the Galactic plane where the extinction is
high even at closer distances.

In particular, we fixed an absolute
Out[]=
minimum stellar mass Mmin to 0.08 M⊙, corresponding to the
limiting mass value in brown dwarfs for which nuclear burning
is inhibited (see Richer et al. 2006). 

In other words, the older the cluster, the lower the mass
of the currently most massive member star (Buzzoni 2002). For
the sake of completeness, we mention that the number of mas-
sive stars may also be reduced because of dynamical eﬀects that
may result in the ejection of stars from the cluster. (Oh et al.
2015) have estimated that clusters more massive than∼103 M⊙
may eject a

\subsection{Mass segregation and elongation of the starburst cluster Westerlund 1⋆}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2469G/abstract

 Mass segregation is a phenomenon observed in many young clus-
ters; some examples are the Orion Nebula Cluster (Hillenbrand &
Hartmann 1998), the NGC 3603 Young Cluster (Stolte et al. 2006;
Harayama, Eisenhauer & Martins 2008) and the Arches Cluster
(Stolte et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2006; Espinoza, Selman & Melnick
2009), and debate is still open whether this phenomenon is either
primordial or due to dynamical evolution. 


This
discrepancy between relaxation time and age is common to many
clusters and has been used as an argument in favour of the primordial
segregation scenario (Bonnell & Davies 1998).

\subsection{Unbound stars hold the key to young star cluster history⋆}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...670A.128A/abstract

Star clusters are the nurseries for most stars (Porras et al. 2003;
Lada & Lada 2003). As such, young star clusters play a vital role
in our understanding of how young stars form and develop. They
signify the starting point for all that happens later on, as they pro-
vide the initial stellar mass distribution (e.g. Kroupa 2002) and
the fraction of stars forming as a single-, binary-, or multiple-
star system (e.g. Duchêne et al. 2018). It is a standard procedure
to use properties of clusters of diﬀerent ages to obtain infor-
mation on the dynamical development of young binary stars or
the dispersal time of discs (e.g. Haisch et al. 2001; Ansdell et al.
2017; Marks et al. 2014; Ribas et al. 2014; Richert et al. 2018;
Michel et al. 2021). Often the task of determining cluster mem-
bership and deriving the temporal development of specific prop-
erties are separate endeavours. While distinguishing members is
a challenge in itself, any bias in membership determination (i.e.
false positives and false negatives) feeds through to the derived
parameters used in other applications.

Until recently, the role of dynamics during the formation his-
tory of young clusters was highly uncertain (e.g. Elmegreen
2000; Fujii et al. 2012; Ward et al. 2012; Banerjee & Kroupa
2017; Dib et al. 2018), mainly because observational limitations hampered precise velocity determination. The precision of data
coming from the Gaia satellite (Gaia Collaboration 2016, 2018,
2021) helped shed light on this issue since a complete under-
standing of the dynamical evolution of present-day clusters
has not been attained yet. 

Clus-
ter expansion was predicted by the gas expulsion scenario
(Mathieu 1983; Lada et al. 1984; Adams 2000; Kroupa et al.
2001; Baumgardt & Kroupa 2007; Pelupessy & Portegies Zwart
2012; Pfalzner & Kaczmarek 2013; Brinkmann et al. 2017;
Pfalzner & Govind 2021). 

During the star formation phase, the
stars are embedded in the gas and dust reservoir from which
they are forming. However, after approximately 1−2 Myr, the
gas starts to be expelled from the clusters by various mechanisms
(e.g. Krumholz et al. 2019; Fujii et al. 2021). Due to loss in gas
and dust mass, the system is no longer in equilibrium. There-
fore, a considerable portion of the stars, bound in the embedded
phase, become unbound in the gas expulsion phase.

The three-dimensional information available from the Gaia
data has been a tremendous step forward in this field. Neverthe-
less, discriminating the members of star clusters and associations
from the foreground and background population is still challeng-
ing (Gagné et al. 2018). 

Many new methods have been devel-
oped for determining the members of open and globular clusters
(e.g. Sollima et al. 2019; Garro et al. 2021; Vitral 2021). Cluster membership determination is challenging in the early expansion
phase (<10 Myr), especially if a clear-cut distinction between
currently bound and formerly bound (i.e. unbound) members is
required. In this case, there are additional diﬃculties to over-
come compared to older clusters. First, the earliest stages of
the formation of star clusters are hidden from view by gas and
dust. Thus, at this young age, veiling is a severe problem. Sec-
ond, the young clusters’ expansion requires additional attention
in membership determination. Third, short- and long-lived clus-
ters coexist during a 10 Myr timespan (Lada & Lada 2003). They
undergo very diﬀerent cluster dynamics (Pfalzner & Kaczmarek
2013), and it is not always straightforward whether a specific
cluster will remain bound for a long time or not.

Historically, star clusters have been identified visually as stel-
lar density enhancements (Dreyer 1888; Trumpler 1930; Bailey
1908; Collinder 1931). Surveys like Hipparcos (Perryman et al.
1997), 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006), and Gaia have each
increased the samples by hundreds of candidate clusters. Due
to Gaia’s high-precision parallax measurements, the clustering
of stars can be analysed in a higher dimensional space by com-
bining their positions in the sky, proper motions, parallaxes, and
radial velocities (when available). For studies which do auto-
mated blind searches with clustering algorithms, the youth of the
stars is used as a confirmation of membership. Such youth indi-
cators can be X-ray activity, infrared excess (Broos et al. 2013;
Feigelson et al. 2013; Getman et al. 2017), lithium abundance
(Soderblom 2010), and gravity-sensitive spectral indices such
as TiO molecular lines (Wilking et al. 2005), empirically con-
structed spectral indices (Damiani et al. 2014), or the shape of
the H-band peak (Scholz et al. 2009)

Among the clustering algorithms, one can distinguish dif-
ferent classes: Density-based spatial clustering like DBSCAN
(Ester et al. 1996; Wilkinson et al. 2018; Zari et al. 2019;
Castro-Ginard et al. 2019, 2020, 2022; Hunt & Reﬀert 2021),
HDBSCAN (Campello et al. 2013), and OPTICS (Ordering
Points To Identify the Clustering Structure; Ankerst et al.
1999), multidimensional Gaussian-based methods (Vasiliev
2019; Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2019; Kuhn et al. 2020), k-means
clustering (MacQueen 1967; Hunt & Reﬀert 2021), and Friend
of Friend algorithm (FoF; Liu & Pang 2019). In addition,
there exist several unsupervised algorithms like UPMASK
(Krone-Martins & Moitinho 2014; Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018;
Cantat-Gaudin & Anders 2020), the nearest neighbour-based
method by He et al. (2021), and STARGO (Tang et al. 2019;
Zhang et al. 2020; Pang et al. 2020).

Young star clusters pose additional challenges compared to
open or globular clusters due to their highly dynamic nature
after gas expulsion. Although space velocity is used to iden-
tify clusters, algorithms rarely consider dynamics. Observations
only provide a snapshot in the dynamic evolution of the clus-
ter. Hence, even clustering in the velocity space at the present
moment might be a chance alignment as the velocity changes
rapidly in young star cluster members. More limitations in iden-
tifying clusters come from Gaia’s poor completeness in crowded
fields and no particular regard for binarity. Moreover, young
clusters are still embedded in natal gas and dust that can not be
penetrated by optical wavelengths, which presents another diﬃ-
culty in identifying and analysing young clusters.

Observations indicate that the entire gas expulsion process
takes ≈1−2 Myr (Kuhn et al. 2019)

Potentially existing initial mass segregation in
the clusters is neglected. <- THIS SIMULATION

4.1. Bound and unbound stars
After gas expulsion, bound and unbound stars coexist in the
same spatial area for some time. Distinguishing the two popu-
lations is vital for some applications; it does not matter or is not
even desirable for others. An example of the latter is the use of
clusters in determining disc lifetimes (Haisch et al. 2001). 

In our simulation, the relevant time frame starts at 2 Myr,
when the gas expulsion happens, and many stars become
unbound. Figure 2 shows snapshots of the distributions of the
stellar distance to the cluster centre and velocity distribution
before (1.8 Myr), just after gas expulsion at 2.3 Myr, during the
expansion process (5 and 10 Myr) and towards the end (20 Myr)
of the expansion phase for an example cluster. The distributions
for the bound (blue) and unbound (red) stars are shown sepa-
rately. As we chose the cluster to be in virial equilibrium, very
few stars become unbound before gas expulsion (see Fig. 2a).
The few unbound stars during this phase result from close
encounters leading to ejections. However, after gas expulsion,
many stars become unbound. Bound and unbound stars share
considerable parts of the phase space for quite some time, as
seen in the bottom row of Fig. 2. This increases the complexity
of making the distinction.

It does not make much sense to make distance and veloc-
ity cutoﬀs in clusters younger than at least 5 Myr to avoid
substantial errors in the classification of the members. However,
even at 5 Myr, the FPR and FNR introduced by a cutoﬀ can be of
the order of 15%−30%.

For the last three decades, it has generally been accepted that
most (70–90%) of star formation in the Milky Way occurs in
embedded clusters, with loose OB associations emerging as rem-
nants of their dissolution (Lada & Lada 1991, 2003). In this
view, often referred to as the ‘monolithic scenario’, embed-
ded clusters emerge as initially bound structures, whose expan-
sion leads to the unbound associations we observe today. This
expansion is often thought to be driven by the expulsion of
residual gas because of stellar feedback (Goodwin & Bastian
2006; Baumgardt & Kroupa 2007; Banerjee & Kroupa 2015);
although, other processes may contribute as well (Gieles et al.
2012).

However, a contemporary alternative view of star formation
has regarded it as a hierarchical process operating over a large
range of scales (Efremov 1979; Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1983;
Larson 1994; Elmegreen & Efremov 1996). In this ’hierarchi-
cal picture’, star formation proceeds on multiple scales, from
kiloparsec-sized super-complexes, to OB associations and star
clusters on smaller scales, down to multiple stellar groupings
and single stars. With stars forming across a continuous dis-
tribution of gas densities, unbound associations may form in
situ, with similar low densities as observed today. In the last
years, access to wide-field observations, along with recent theo-
retical results have contributed to consolidate this view of the
in situ formation of unbound associations in the Milky Way
and beyond (Bressert et al. 2010; Gouliermis 2018; Grudi´ c et al.
2018; Ward et al. 2020).
Historically, the two views of star formation proceeded
more or less separately on diﬀerent scales, which was motivated by observational circumstances: the works discussing
the hierarchical picture (e.g. Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1983;
Elmegreen & Efremov 1996) looked typically at large, galactic-
scale fields, whereas the monolithic scenario emerged from stud-
ies over small field-of-view observations of star-forming regions
possible with infrared arrays available in the 1990s. Although
the two views of star formation are sometimes presented as
being opposed to each other, they should better be viewed as
being complementary and operating on diﬀerent scales. It may
as well be that there exist both types of OB associations, those
that formed in situ as well as the expanded ones. After all, hav-
ing 70−90% of stars forming in embedded clusters, as claimed
by Lada & Lada (2003), is still compatible with a fair number
forming ‘on the loose’; although, the exact percentages may be
revisited in the future.

Detailed studies of young stellar object (YSO) populations
in both embedded and non-embedded regions have revealed that
most star-forming regions appear to be clumpy, with their popu-
lations distributed in several subclusters (Kuhn et al. 2014, 2021;
Sills et al. 2018). Measurements of internal kinematics of these
subclusters are needed to understand how they relate to each
other, that is to say whether the tendency is towards merging into
larger clusters, or a dispersal of individual subclusters once the
molecular gas is gone from the system. However, detailed stud-
ies of internal kinematics and structural properties of young star
clusters have been challenging due to instrumental issues (the
need for high-precision astrometry or, alternatively, radial veloc-
ities for a large number of stars), as well as due to those related
to the determination of membership. Recently, both issues have
seen major improvements thanks to Gaia (Gaia Collaboration
2016), which led to precise measurements of velocity dispersion
and the detection of expansion patterns in a substantial number
of clusters younger than 5 Myr (Kuhn et al. 2019). As of the
membership selections, those based on optical and near-infrared
(NIR) photometry typically suﬀer from significant contamina-
tion by field objects, while X-ray and mid-infrared-excess selec-
tions, though quite robust, come with a bias towards objects with
a particular set of properties, and they are unable to uncover
entire populations. Spectroscopy, on the other hand, becomes
unfeasible for regions spanning large areas, and consequently
containing large numbers of objects. Precise proper motions,
especially when combined with parallaxes for systems relatively
close to the Sun, provide a crucial piece of information for mem-
bership determination, and can be combined with photometric
criteria to uncover reliable sets of pre-main sequence (PMS) can-
didate members.

Recently, various machine learning (ML) techniques,
both supervised and unsupervised, have been used to aid in
this process, and have provided membership lists in a large
number of regions, from the youngest ones with ages of
∼1 Myr to the oldest known open clusters (e.g. Gao 2018;
Marton et al. 2019; Miret-Roig et al. 2019; Melton 2020;
Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018; Cantat-Gaudin & Anders 2020;
Galli et al. 2021; Peña Ramírez et al. 2021). While the unsu-
pervised techniques can eﬃciently deal with a large number of
clusters and thus help to improve the statistics on the overall
properties of young Galactic populations, they may still come
with some non-negligible amount of contamination. On the
other hand, supervised ML techniques allow us to use all
the prior knowledge on the properties of cluster population,
potentially resulting in cleaner candidate member lists. This,
of course, brings the challenge of properly selecting a training
set, since all biases and the contamination of this training
set will be propagated towards the final classification and thus to the sample that will be used for further astrophysical

Star clusters can undergo significant changes not only at birth but
also during the course of their dynamical evolutions. It is therefore
essential to specify to what extent the present-day properties of a star
cluster, e.g. their degree of mass segregation, are imprinted by early
evolution and the formation processes, and to what extent they are
the outcome of long-term dynamical evolution.
In a star cluster with different stellar masses, the more massive
stars sink towards the central regions, while the lighter stars on
average move further away from the centre via relaxation processes.
This so-called dynamical mass segregation is a natural outcome of
energy equipartition driven by two-body encounters and happens on
a time-scale, which is of the order of several two-body relaxation
times (Spitzer 1969).
However, a number of observational studies (Hillenbrand \&
Hartmann 1998; de Grijs et al. 2002; Stolte et al. 2006; Sheikhi et al.
2016) have found evidence of mass segregation in clusters with ages
shorter than the time needed to produce the observed segregation via
two-body relaxation.
It has been suggested that the observed mass segregation in young
clusters could be primordial and possibly imprinted by the early star
formation process (Bonnell \& Davies 1998; Bonnell \& Bate 2002,
2006).
Such mass segregation could be due to the higher accretion rate of
protostars in high-density regions of molecular clouds fragmenting
into clumps.
Moreover, there are some exceptional diffuse outer-halo globular
clusters (e.g. Palomar 4, Palomar 14) with present-day half-mass
relaxation times exceeding the Hubble time. Therefore, no dynamical
mass segregation is expected in these clusters. Frank et al. (2012) and
Frank, Grebel \& K¨
upper (2014) have found clear evidence for mass
segregation of main-sequence stars in Pal 4 and Pal 14. Because of
the large two-body relaxation time scales of these clusters, this could
be interpreted as evidence of PMS. Zonoozi et al. (2011, 2014, 2017)
have presented a comprehensive set of N-body computations of Pal
14 and Pal 4 over a Hubble time, and compared the results to the
observed parameters from Jordi et al. (2009) and Frank et al. (2012)
and showed that a very high degree of PMS would be necessary to
explain the observed characteristics.
To estimate the degree of mass segregation for each OC in our
sample, we divided the luminosity of cluster stars into three groups
(L/L⊙ > 1, 1 > L/L⊙ > 0.1, and L/L⊙ < 0.02) and counted the
number of main sequence stars in each group inside the tidal radius.
The radial cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculated from
the cluster centre is shown in Fig. 10. For other four clusters see

Compared with Gaia DR2, the astrometric data in Gaia EDR3/DR3 are superior. For example, at G=17 mag, the average uncertainty of parallax in Gaia DR3 is 0.07mas, compared to 0.1 mas in Gaia DR2. Additionally, the proper motions in Gaia EDR3/DR3 have improved threefold, from 0.2 to 0.07 mas yr−1. It should be noted that for distant cluster searches, the improvement of parallax values may not change significantly when separating two distant stars. For example, comparing two stars at 1 and 2 kpc, the parallax differential is 0.5mas. For stars at 5 and 10kpc, the differential is only 0.1 mas, which approaches the mean parallax error for G = 17 mag. Since farther clusters are usually fainter than nearby objects, the member stars on the main sequence are mostly under 17–18 mag.

\subsection{A dynamical study of Galactic globular clusters
under different relaxation conditions}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...539A..65Z/abstract
It is well known that for most globular clusters the relevant relax-
ation times are shorter than their age. Therefore, since the two-
body relaxation processes have had time to act, these systems
may be considered to be close to thermodynamical relaxation,
with a distribution function that should be close to a Maxwellian.
The spherical King models (King 1966) are defined by a
distribution function of this type, with a truncation in energy
introduced to mimic the role of tides (for the relevant defini-
tion and a summary of the main properties, see Appendix A.1).
In general, they are thought to be a physically justified simple
tool to represent quasi-relaxed stellar systems, in particular well
suited to describe globular clusters. In this context, King mod-
els are usually considered as the correct zeroth-order dynamical
reference model. The available catalogs (e.g., see Harris 2010)
record a number of structural properties of globular clusters that
are derived from an interpretation of observational data based
on the use of King models. The family of King models is also
frequently used in dynamical studies aimed at identifying given
physical mechanisms and represents a most popular choice of
initial conditions for numerical simulations designed to investi-
gate the dynamical evolution of star clusters (e.g., see Chernoﬀ
& Weinberg 1990; and, more recently, Gieles & Baumgardt
2008).
\subsection{Pre-main-sequence stars older than 8 Myr in the Eagle nebula}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.3058D/abstract
In the current paradigm of star formation (see e.g. Lada 1999, and
references therein) conservation of angular momentum during the
collapse of cloud cores leads to the formation of circumstellar discs
around newly born stars. The presence and evolution of circumstel-
lar discs is important both for planets, which find in discs the natural
sites for their formation, and for the star itself, whose mass growth
during the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase depends on accretion
of gas from the disc. Therefore, the time-scale of disc dissipation
sets crucial constraints for models of stars and planets formation.

Over the past decade, many studies have tried to address these
issues observationally. Based on the assumption that a near-infrared
(NIR) or mid-infrared (MIR) spectral excess in young stars is the
unambiguous signature of an inner circumstellar dusty disc, as origi-
nally suggested by Lada & Wilking (1984), these works have looked
⋆E-mail: gdemarchi@rssd.esa.int
at the fraction of objects in stellar systems of various ages that
still show NIR and MIR excess in their spectra (e.g. Haisch, Lada
& Lada 2001; Bouwman et al. 2006; Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2006;
Hern´ andez et al. 2008). This analysis suggests a rapid decline of the
disc frequency as age proceeds, with 50 per cent of low-mass stars
losing their inner dust discs within∼3 Myr. However, disc evo-
lution is poorly constrained for ages above∼5 Myr, due to small
number statistics both in the number of star-forming regions and
in the total number of stars studied. A few well-established cases
of long-lived dusty discs have been found so far. These include the
double cluster h and χ Persei, with up to 8 per cent of its members
still showing infrared (IR) excess at 8 µm at an age of∼13 Myr
(Currie et al. 2007a), and the Scorpius–Centaurus (Sco–Cen) OB
association, with about one third of the stars showing IR excess at
24 µm at ages in the range∼10–17 Myr (Chen et al. 2011).

Fedele et al. (2010) have compared the fraction of actively accret-
ing stars with spectral type later than K0 in seven nearby clusters
and associations with that of stars surrounded by dusty discs in
the same systems. They found that at any given age the fraction of
stars with ongoing mass accretion (as determined from the proper-
ties of the Hα emission line) is systematically lower than that of
stars with NIR or MIR excess, and concluded that the exponential
decay time-scale for mass accretion (2.3 Myr) is even shorter than
the time-scale for the dissipation of dusty discs mentioned above
(3 Myr). We note, however, that this analysis does not explicitly
take into account the effects of temporal variability of the Hα emis-
sion line (see e.g. Johns & Basri 1995; Alencar & Batalha 2002;
Jayawardhana et al. 2006). Therefore, it only sets a lower limit to
the fraction of actively accreting stars, but the time-scale for the
dissipation of gaseous discs is likely longer than 2.3 Myr (see also
Bell et al. 2013).

Studies of the regions around SN 1987A and 30 Dor in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have revealed populations of PMS
objects with considerable Hα excess emission (i.e. an Hα equivalent
width above 20 Å), showing ages of∼15–20 Myr and a spatial distri-
bution markedly different from that of younger ( 5 Myr) PMS stars
(De Marchi et al. 2010a; De Marchi et al. 2011a; Spezzi et al. 2012).
Similarly, NGC 346 and NC 602 in the Small Magellanic Cloud con-
tain a conspicuous population of∼20 Myr old PMS objects with
mass accretion rates higher than 10−8 M⊙ yr−1 (De Marchi et al.
2011b,c, 2013). The low metallicity of the Magellanic Clouds could be at the
origin of the elevated mass accretion rates and older PMS ages
measured in these works, as suggested by De Marchi et al. (2010,
2011c) and Spezzi et al. (2012). However, also in the Milky Way
there are examples of active PMS stars with solar metallicity that
are older than∼10 Myr. They were detected through their excess
Hα emission e.g. in NGC 3603 (Beccari et al. 2010; Correnti et al.
2012) and in NGC 6167 (Baume et al. 2011).
It is well known that, in general, reflection nebulae appear bluer
than the illuminating stars because the scattering cross-section of
grains is higher at shorter wavelengths (e.g. Henyey & Greenstein
1938). For the same reason, if a conspicuous fraction of the light
that we receive from a PMS object is radiation scattered by the
circumstellar disc, its optical colours could be bluer than those of
the stellar photosphere and could make the object appear older in
the CMD. This in turn requires the bulk of the optical photospheric
flux to be blocked (i.e. absorbed and hence reddened) by an almost
edge-on circumstellar disc, which makes at the same time the object
considerably fainter. We clarify this scenario first with a simple
order of magnitude calculation and then we confirm its validity
using models of the spectral energy distribution of PMS stars.

discovery of six new δ Scuti and one γ Doradus stars}

% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.2606R/abstract
In this context, intermediate-mass PMS stars (with mass in the
range 1–8 M⊙, also called Herbig Ae/Be stars) are particularly
useful. After the seminal work by Marconi & Palla (1998), who
established the locus of the theoretical instability strip in the HR
diagram, it has become clear that these stars pulsate as δ Sct vari-
ables (see e.g. Ripepi et al. 2002, 2003; Marconi & Palla 2004;
Ripepi et al. 2006a,b; Zwintz 2008 and references therein). More
recently, high-precision photometry from space missions such as MOST and CoRoT showed that   intermediate-mass PMS stars can
also pulsate as hybrid δ Sct/γ Dor stars (Ripepi et al. 2011) or pure
γ Dor stars (Zwintz et al. 2013)

In general, the distinctive properties of young A- and F-type stars
(also known as Herbig Ae stars) are the presence of Hα emission (or
filling of the line) in their spectrum, a luminosity class III–V, and the
presence of excess infrared emission due to circumstellar dust (see
e.g. van den Ancker, de Winter & Tjin A Djie 1998, and references
therein).

METHOD AND APPLICATION TO THE SN 1987A FIELD∗}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...715....1D/abstract
It is noteworthy that the majority of PMS objects in Figure 8
are rather close to the MS and would have easily been missed if
no information on their Hα excess had been available. Indeed, it
is customary to identify PMS stars in a color–magnitude diagram
by searching for objects located above and to the right of the MS,
since this is where one would expect to find very young objects.
This method was first used by Gilmozzi et al. (1994) to identify
a population of PMS stars outside the Milky Way, namely, in
the LMC cluster NGC 1850. More recent applications of this
method include, e.g., those of Sirianni et al. (2000), Nota et al.
(2006), and Gouliermis et al. (2007).
Unfortunately, this method of identification is not very
reliable, since the existence of an age spread and the presence in the same field of a considerably older population, as well as
unaccounted patchy absorption, all tend to fill up the parameter
space between the MS and the birth line, thereby thwarting any
attempts to identify PMS stars on the basis of their effective
temperature and luminosity alone.

\subsection{A simple two-component description of energy equipartition and
mass segregation for anisotropic globular clusters}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...632A..67T/abstract

For globular clusters, the most widely used models, the King
models (King 1966) were developed under the guiding picture
that for many clusters, given their long age, two-body relaxation
processes have had suﬃcient time to act and play an important
role in determining the dynamical properties of the systems that
we observe today. King models are thought to describe round,
non-rotating stellar systems made of a single stellar population,
for which internal two-body relaxation has had time to bring
the system close to a Maxwellian, isotropic distribution func-
tion. A truncation is considered to take into account the presence
of tidal eﬀects. The success of one-component King models was
largely due to their simplicity (the family of models is charac-
terized by only one dimensionless parameter, the concentration
parameter c) and to their ability to fit, under the assumption of
a constant mass-to-light ratio, the photometric profiles of most
clusters in our Galaxy over large radial/magnitude ranges (e.g.,
see Djorgovski & Meylan 1994; Harris 1996).

One of the eﬀects of two-body interactions is to lead sys-
tems made of stars with diﬀerent masses toward a state of energy
equipartition. That is to say, we would expect collisions to enforce
a condition in which the velocity dispersion σ of stars of mass
m should scale as σ∼ m−1/2. In self-gravitating systems, the
establishment of this process is very complicated, because of
their inhomogeneous nature and their self-consistent dynamics.
In turn, as a consequence of two-body relaxation processes, more
massive stars are expected to be characterized by a more con-
centrated density distribution, a phenomenon usually referred to
as mass segregation. This was soon realized to pose a contra-
diction to the simple use of one-component models in the inter-
pretation of the observations, and eﬀorts were made to extend
the King models to a more realistic multi-component version
(Da Costa & Freeman 1976; see also Merritt 1981)

On the
dynamical side, especially because gravity is a natural source of
inhomogeneities, it was also found that interesting dynami-
cal mechanisms might be induced by the natural trend toward
equipartition and mass segregation. In particular, arguments were
provided in favor of the existence of an instability related to mass
segregation (Spitzer 1969), distinct from the gravothermal catas-
trophe (Lynden-Bell & Wood 1968). With the help of a very sim-
ple two-component model, made of light and heavy stars, Spitzer
suggested that a condition of global energy equipartition cannot
be fulfilled if the total mass of the heavy stars exceeds a cer-
tain fraction of the total mass of the cluster. The Spitzer criterion
(often interpreted as a criterion for instability) was later extended
by Vishniac (1978) to cover the case of a continuous spectrum of
masses. In general, as shown by the discussion that followed the
study by Spitzer (e.g., see Merritt 1981), energy equipartition and,
in particular, the distinction between local and global equiparti-
tion, are subtle concepts that require clarification.

In addition, evidence for a certain
degree of mass segregation has been collected for several globu-
lar clusters (e.g., see van der Marel & Anderson 2010; Di Cecco
et al. 2013; Goldsbury et al. 2013; Bellini et al. 2014; Webb
& Vesperini 2017). 

Among the interesting models characterized by
pressure anisotropy, we can mention the Michie-King models
(Michie 1963) and the LIMEPY models (Gieles & Zocchi 2015).
Multi-component versions of these models have been tested with
some success both as a description of data and of the results of
N-body simulations (Gunn & Griﬃn 1979; Sollima et al. 2015;
Peuten et al. 2017). The general goal of these studies appears
to be to propose realistic models by using the freedom oﬀered
by the presence of some additional parameters (see the pioneer-
ing work by Da Costa & Freeman 1976)

\subsection{Mass segregation in young compact star clusters in the Large Magellanic
Cloud – II. Mass functions}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.331..245D/abstract

Dynamical mass segregation in the cluster cores will have
occurred on 10–20 times shorter time-scales, in particular for the
more massive stars (cf. equation 2). In fact, if the cluster contains a
significant amount of gas, for example, Mgas * Mstars (cf. Lada
1991; Bonnell & Davies 1998), this will increase the gravitational
potential of the cluster, and thus the virialized stellar velocity
dispersion (Bonnell & Davies 1998). Therefore, in this case a
larger number of two-body encounters, and hence time, is required
to reach a dynamically relaxed state. Thus, the relaxation time
estimates obtained by considering only the contributions of the
stellar component of the cluster should be considered lower limits,
especially for young star clusters, which are generally rich in gas.

\subsection{Investigating Mass Segregation of the Binary Stars in the Open Cluster NGC 6819}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...967...44Z/abstract

Since these studies were published, we now have access to
precise kinematic and parallax information for stars in NGC
6819 from Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2023). These
data are extremely helpful in separating eld stars from cluster
members (Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018). Indeed, Karataş et al.
(2023) used Gaia EDR3 data to isolate cluster members in
NGC 6819 (and other clusters) to study the cluster structure,
dynamics, mass segregation, and Galactic orbit. Reliably
distinguishing cluster members is particularly important for
mass-segregation studies; as the cluster itself becomes sparser
farther from the cluster center, eld–star contamination
becomes more of a concern and may impact the derived
luminosity and mass distributions and radial pro les. In this
study, we use Gaia radial-velocity, proper-motion, and parallax
measurements (where available), along with a photometric
membership analysis, to identify probable cluster members and
limit the effects of eld–star contamination.
Importantly, here we focus on the binary stars. For a given
primary star mass, a binary (containing two stars) is more
massive than the corresponding single star, and therefore mass-
segregation effects are expected to move the binaries into a more
centrally concentrated radial distribution than the singles. On the
other hand, close gravitational encounters between binaries and
other cluster members, which happen preferentially in the dense cluster core, can also destroy binaries (e.g., Hills 1975). Models
predict that by a dynamical age similar to that of NGC 6819,
mass segregation will dominate over binary destruction (Geller
et al. 2013a). Indeed, studies of older rich open and globular
clusters have found the binaries to be more centrally
concentrated than the single stars (e.g., Geller et al. 2008,
2015b; Milone et al. 2012; Jadhav et al. 2021).

However, observational evidence of mass segregation in
clusters around the age of NGC 6819 is mixed. Dib et al.
(2018) characterized mass segregation in 1276 open clusters
and found that only 14% of these clusters showed signi cant
evidence of mass segregation. Of these 1276 open clusters,
nine have cluster ages that are within ±50 Myr of the age of
NGC 6819, and only four of these show some evidence of mass
segregation. The ubiquity of mass segregation for binary stars
in particular becomes even less certain, in part because
identifying unresolved binaries and mapping their radial
distribution is a challenge. For example, Jadhav et al. (2021)
studied multiple open clusters and found that >50% of the
open clusters in their study do not show signi cant evidence of
mass segregation of the binary stars relative to the single stars.
More speci cally, of the 23 open clusters they studied, three
have ages within∼1 Gyr of NGC 6819 (though all are younger
than NGC 6819), and of these, two show some evidence of
mass segregation of the binaries; however, one of these has a
mass much smaller than NGC 6819. 

\subsection{New Insights into the Structure of Open Clusters in the Gaia Era}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...54Z/abstract

According to the numerical experimental results of Danilov &
Dorogavtseva (2008), after 150 Myr of the open cluster
evolution, the total extent of the tidal tails can reach 1.2 kpc.
Tutukov et al. (2020) develop a concept of the stellar streams
forming due to the decay of star clusters, which can nally
form the tor-like structures in the Galactic disk. It can be seen
that the tidal tail of star clusters is mainly formed by the motion
and dynamical evolution in the Milky way. On the other hand,
according to the dynamical study by Danilov et al. (2014), the
corona of the cluster is a long-lived structure outside the zero-
velocity surface, whose temporal stability is determined by the existence of the periodical retrograde orbits (with periods
comparable to the mean lifetime of the cluster) and the
trajectories close to such orbits. Therefore, the outer halo
component can be regarded as an important part of star clusters.

The study of the outer structure of clusters is crucial in
understanding the formation and evolution of star clusters. The
existence of a tidal structure in the extended region revealed by
Gaia data can help one better understand the dynamic evolution
of star clusters and further reveal the evolution timescale of star
clusters in the Milky way (Krumholz et al. 2019). It is worth
noting that young star clusters also have originally formed
outer halo structures (Zhong et al. 2019; Meingast et al. 2021).

\subsection{Structural properties of subgroups of stars associated with open clusters}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240800140G/abstract

In the studies of stellar groupings, mass segregation and high
surface density of sources are the properties typically ex-
pected in young star clusters. However, many stellar groups
showing more or less concentrated clustering have been ob-
served probably due to different conditions for star forma-
tion and dynamical evolution, such as NGC 2264 (Gonz´alez
& Alfaro 2017), NGC 2548 (Vicente et al. 2016), NGC 6231
(Kuhn et al. 2017), NGC 3105 (Davidge 2017), and NGC 346
(Schmeja et al. 2009), among other examples. The formation
of bound clusters or dispersed stellar groups depends on the
initial physical condition of turbulence effects in a molecular
cloud (Elmgreen 2008). For instance, recently formed clus-
ters tend to follow the fractal structure of the clouds where
they are found embedded (e.g. Elmgreen 2018).

their natal star-forming regions hints at the hierarchical

These properties also help
to constrain the initial conditions used in N-body simulation models
which investigate cluster evolution (Pijloo et al. 2015; Rossi, Bekki &
Hurley 2016).
Clusters are affected and disrupted by internal processes (stellar
winds, internal interactions, and mass loss due to stellar evolution)
and external processes (supernova, collision with molecular clouds,
and forces interacting with the Galactic potential) depending on their
lifetime. These processes could change the mass of the clusters and
reduce their size (Spitzer 1958; Joshi et al. 2016) although the details
are still being debated. Clusters may also dissolve with dissolution
times that can depend on several factors such as initial cluster mass
and internal structure, as well as on the external effects mentioned
previously (see e.g. Goodwin & Bastian 2006 and Portegies Zwart,
McMillan & Gieles 2010 regarding massive young clusters).

King profile method involves fitting a King profile function to the
measured density profile of the cluster, assuming that the cluster
is in dynamical equilibrium. The determined core radius and tidal
radius of the cluster are then used to calculate the mass. Direct use
of the Virial theorem has also been used to get the cluster mass,
as discussed in McNamara & Sanders (1983) and Raboud (1996).

Due to its proximity, Pleiades is one of the most studied open clus-
ters; however, only in 1998 with the work of Raboud & Mermilliod
(1998a) it was possible to reliably estimate its mass based on a list
of 270 members. The authors found mass segregation in binary and
individual stars with masses up to 1.0 M⊙. They estimated the mass
of the Pleiades through different methods: tidal radius (4000 ± 4000)
M⊙, Virial theorem (720 ± 220) M⊙, MF integration (950 ± 200)
M⊙, and by the sum of the stellar masses of the sample (412) M⊙.

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...615A..37B/abstract

1. Introduction
The majority of stars form in clusters and associations inside gi-
ant molecular clouds. However, most clusters dissipate within
10 – 100 Myr, leaving more than 90% of the stellar popula-
tion dispersed in the Galactic field (e.g., Lada & Lada 2003;
Piskunov et al. 2006). The scientific debate on the origin of
bound and unbound clusters, along with the processes leading
to their dissolution, is still open. Several authors suggest that
all stars form in dense clusters (density 103
− 104 stars pc−3),
which rapidly dissipate after feedback from massive stars (i.e.,
supernova explosions, stellar winds, and radiation pressure)
sweeps out the gas that was keeping the cluster bound (e.g.,
Tutukov 1978; Lada et al. 1984; Goodwin 1997; Kroupa et al.
2001; Goodwin & Bastian 2006; Baumgardt & Kroupa 2007;
Bastian 2011). These models predict that clusters – after gas
dispersion – should be found in a supervirial state. Recent ob-
servations and simulations question this scenario suggesting that
clusters have origin in a hierarchically structured environment
covering a large range of densities and that the stellar feedback
and gas expulsion are irrelevant for the cluster dispersion, which

So far, all these studies have focused on clusters younger
than 10 – 20 Myr. Nevertheless the complete understand-
ing of the cluster dispersion process requires the study
of slightly older (age∼ 20 – 50 Myr) systems. Clus-
ters in this age range have already lost their residual gas
and have nearly completed the process of "violent relax-
ation" predicted by models based on stellar feedback (e.g.,

Relation to Cluster Dynamics}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912..162P/abstract


The earliest morphological study of OCs dates back a
century (Jeans 1916). In the decades that followed, further
systematic studies were carried out; notable studies include
those of Oort (1979) and Bergond et al. (2001). They
investigated the spatial distribution of a handful of nearby
OCs and found that the attening of the projected shape of OCs
tends to be parallel to the Galactic plane. The pioneering work
of Chen et al. (2004) determined the 2D morphology of 31
nearby OCs using Two Micron All Sky Survey infrared
photometry; they took an important rst step in the statistical
investigation of OC morphology. However, they did not reach
a rm quantitative conclusion because of the challenges arising
from membership determination.

Differences between the morphologies of young and old
OCs were identi ed by Jones & Basu (2002). Young OCs tend
to have a higher degree of substructure. Sánchez & Alfaro
(2009) found that clusters with fractal-like structures are
generally younger than clusters with smooth radial density
pro les. Kounkel & Covey (2019) identi ed several hundred
lamentary structures younger than 100 Myr, most of which
were associated with nearby OCs. One string-like structure in
Kounkel & Covey (2019), for example, hosts two coeval open
clusters, NGC 2232 and LP 2439 (Pang et al. 2020). The
extended substructures of young OCs are thought to have been
inherited from the primordial shape of the parental GMCs
(Ballone et al. 2020), in which star formation takes place along
the densest lamentary substructures (Jerabkova et al. 2019).

After the rst
stars have formed, the gas surrounding the OCs is rapidly
removed by stellar radiation (Krumholz & Matzner 2009;Dinnbier & Walch 2020), stellar winds (Weaver et al. 1977), or
supernovae (McKee & Ostriker 1977). Stars that escape from the
cluster after gas expulsion reduce the gravitational potential of the
cluster and form a tidal“tail I” (following the de nition and
nomenclature of Dinnbier & Kroupa 2020b). Expansion has been
observed in very young OCs with ages less than 5 Myr (Kuhn
et al. 2019), as well as in young clusters that are tens of millions of
years old (Brandner et al. 2008; Bravi et al. 2018; Getman et al.
2018; Karnath et al. 2019; Pang et al. 2020).

Simultaneously, the stellar members of an OC interact with
each other through two-body relaxation, which results in the
observed“mass segregation” in star clusters (Hillenbrand &
Hartmann 1998; Pang et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2018), in which
low-mass stars are dispersed to the outskirts of the cluster and
massive stars tend to migrate to the central region of the cluster.
Consequently, a dense core will form, while low-mass stars
continue to escape from the cluster, mainly at low speeds
through Lagrange points (Küpper et al. 2008), and form an
S-shaped tidal“tail II” (following the nomenclature of Dinnbier
& Kroupa 2020b). The reduction of cluster members further
lowers the gravitational potential, which results in expansion of
OCs and consequently a lower stellar number density. Chen
et al. (2004) proposed that the internal relaxation process
causes the inner part of a cluster to evolve into a spherical
spatial distribution

As the Galactic disk is abundant in stars, spiral arms, and
GMCs, OCs are subjected to external tidal perturbations, such
as disk shocks, spiral arm passages, and encounters with
molecular clouds (Spitzer 1958; Lamers et al. 2005; Kruijssen
et al. 2012). Stars escape the cluster as a consequence of gas
expulsion, close encounters, or evaporation, and due to their
exposure to the Coriolis force produced by the Galactic tidal
eld, migrate to more tangential orbits. As a consequence, the
star cluster stretches. Furthermore, when OCs cross the
Galactic plane, the disk tidal eld compresses them and attens
their shapes. The projected major axes of the elongated shapes
of OCs are known to be aligned with the Galactic plane in most
cases (Oort 1979; Bergond et al. 2001; Chen et al. 2004). As
OCs evolve, their shapes continue to distort and members
disperse, leading to the inevitable dissolution of the entire
cluster. Expansion has been identi ed in old open clusters as a
sign of an ongoing disruption process (Pang et al. 2018). Giant
tidal tails extending from OCs have been directly observed in
recent years (Fürnkranz et al. 2019; Meingast & Alves 2019;
Röser et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020). These
observed tidal tails are thought to be composed of both a“tail
I,” driven by gas expulsion, and a“tail II,” driven by
evaporation (Dinnbier & Kroupa 2020a, 2020b).

\subsection{Tidal tails of open star clusters as probes to early gas expulsion}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...640A..85D/abstract

The formation of star clusters commences in infrared dark
clouds, which are the densest parts of giant molecular clouds.
Young massive stars formed within the cloud impart a large
amount of energy to the cloud in several diﬀerent forms: ion-
ising radiation (Spitzer 1978; Tenorio-Tagle 1979; Whitworth
1979),stellarwinds(Castor et al.1975;Weaver et al.1977),radia-
tion pressure (Pellegrini et al. 2007; Krumholz & Matzner 2009),
and later (after 3 Myr) supernovae (Sedov 1945; Taylor 1950;
McKee & Ostriker 1977; Ostriker & McKee 1988; Cioﬃ et al.
1988; Blondin et al. 1998). The plethora of feedback processes
opposes and eventually overcomes the self-gravity of the cloud
while its gaseous content decreases as it turns into stars, trans-
forming the initially embedded cluster to a gas free cluster. 

For example, Banerjee & Kroupa (2017) suggest that the large observed size of star clusters at an age of
≈2−40 Myr cannot be obtained by purely stellar dynamics, but it
can be a consequence of rapid gas expulsion and SFEs of ≈30%
(see also Pfalzner 2009).

Within the nearest 500 pc, low-mass young stellar ob-
jects (YSOs) can be detected by modern instruments across
most of the initial mass function over a wide range of
wavelengths. Due to the emission from surrounding dust
in envelopes and/or disks, YSOs are best identified at in-
frared wavelengths where all but the most embedded proto-
stars are detectable (see §4). Older pre-main-sequence stars
that have lost their circumstellar dust are not revealed in
the infrared but can be identified in X-ray surveys (e.g.,
Audard et al., 2007; Winston et al., 2010; Pillitteri et al.,
2013).

2.1. Identification
YSOs are generally identified in the infrared by their red
colors relative to foreground and background stars. Re-
liable identification is difficult since many other objects
have similar colors, including star-forming galaxies, active
galactic nuclei (AGN), background asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars, and knots of shock-heated emission. Selec-
tion criteria based on position in various color-color and
color-magnitude diagrams have been developed to separate
YSOs from these contaminants and are described in detail
by Harvey et al. (2007) for the c2d and Gould Belt sur-
veys and by Gutermuth et al. (2009), Megeath et al. (2009,
2012), and Kryukova et al. (2012) for the Orion survey.

Some crucial assumptions enter the dynamical mass deter-
mination based on fitting a King profile: a) The OC fills its
Roche lobe in the tidal field of the Milky Way. For compact (e.g.
Roche-lobe underfilling) clusters, rJ and as a consequence the
mass can be underestimated by a large amount; b) The eﬀect of
mass segregation can be neglected, i.e., star counts on the up-
per main sequence, which dominate the observed cluster mem-
bers, are representative of the mass distribution; c) The elliptic
shape of the clusters and the contamination by tidal tail stars
do not result in a systematic bias. Shape parameters were mea-
sured by Kharchenko et al. (2009) and the distribution of tidal
tail stars have been investigated in detail (e.g. Just et al. 2009);
d) The tidal radius rt determined by fitting the cumulative pro-
jected mass profile represents the Jacobi radius rJ used to derive
the cluster mass. Since the cluster mass depends on the third
power of rJ, the method is very sensitive to systematic errors in
the derivation of rJ.

\subsection{Searching for New Observational Signatures of the Dynamical Evolution of Star Clusters}

% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..118B/abstract

Globular clusters (GCs) are collisional stellar systems, where
frequent gravitational interactions among stars signi cantly
alter the overall energy budget, leading to a progressive internal
change in the cluster structure and in the radial distribution and
content of objects with different masses: the most massive stars
tend to transfer kinetic energy to lower-mass objects (energy
equipartition) and progressively sink toward the system center
(dynamical friction and mass segregation); the energy transfer
between stars causes the gradual loss (evaporation) of stars
(preferentially low-mass ones). The continuous kinetic energy
transfer from the core to the outskirts leads to a runaway
contraction of the core itself, with a substantial increase in its
density toward an in nite value: the so-called“core collapse”
(hereafter, CC; see, e.g., Spitzer 1987; Meylan & Heggie 1997).
The contraction is thought to be halted by the formation and
hardening of binary systems, and the post-CC phase is
characterized by several episodes of increasing central density,
followed by stages during which the cluster rebounds toward a
structure with lower density and a more extended core (the so-
called“gravothermal oscillations”; e.g., Meylan & Heg-
gie 1997). Clearly, these processes signi cantly affect the
structure of the system with respect to the initial conditions.
Overall, the long-term internal dynamical evolution tends to
generate compact clusters, making large-core systems naturally
evolve toward objects with progressively smaller core radius
(Rc). Concurrently, the radial distribution of stars with different
masses progressively varies in time (the most massive objects migrating to the center), and the high-density cluster environ-
ment may facilitate the formation of exotic species that are not
predicted by stellar evolution theory (such as blue straggler
stars, millisecond pulsars, low-mass X-ray binaries, intermedi-
ate-mass black holes; e.g., Ferraro et al. 1997; Pooley et al.
2003; Ransom et al. 2005).
The characteristic timescales of these changes depend in a
very complex way on the various internal and external
properties, such as total cluster mass, initial size, central
density, binary fraction, orbit within the Galactic potential well,
and so on. Hence, they can signi cantly differ even in clusters
of the same chronological (stellar) age and, within the same
system, from high- to low-density regions. Because of such
complexity, the observational identi cation of the evolutionary
stage reached by a cluster (i.e., its“dynamical age”) may be
hard and lead to ambiguous conclusions. Of course, this may
signi cantly hamper efforts aimed at linking the theoretical
predictions concerning the dynamics of star clusters with
observations

6.5 Mass Segregation in Young Clusters
Observational support for the importance of collisional dynamics at young ages comes from
the (low) densities of young-stellar objects in the solar neighbourhood, which is consistent
with the density distribution of a population of dynamically expanding (i.e. post-collapse)
low-mass star clusters (few 100 stars, Gieles et al. 2012).
Collisional dynamics will equalise “temperature” between stars and hence the kinetic
energy per star. More massive stars will therefore acquire lower velocities to have the same
kinetic energy as the lower mass stars. The high-mass stars will therefore be found deeper
in the potential well, i.e., closer to the centre of the cluster. This is called mass segregation.
Dynamical mass segregation is a consequence of two-body relaxation, whereas primordial
mass segregation describes a situation where the massive stars already form in the centre.
The observational assessment of mass segregation is mixed. Young star clusters show
signs of mass segregation (Hillenbrand and Hartmann 1998; de Grijs et al. 2002; Littlefair
et al. 2003; Stolte et al. 2005, 2006; Kim et al. 2006; Harayama et al. 2008; Espinoza et al.
2009; Bontemps et al. 2010; Gennaro et al. 2011). However, observations of pre-main se-
quence stars in star-forming regions do not indicate mass segregation (Parker et al. 2011,
2012; Gennaro et al. 2017; Parker and Alves de Oliveira 2017; Dib et al. 2018). Plunkett
et al. (2018) find the prestellar cores in Serpens South to be mass-segregated, whereas the
pre-main sequence stars are not. The complexity of defining the details of clusters and sub-
clusters in combination with measurement differences complicate the problem of the dis-
tribution of masses. Kirk and Myers (2011) observe mass segregation in small groups in
Taurus. Investigating the stellar distribution in total, Parker et al. (2011) find the most mas-
sive stars to be inversely mass segregated.
Parker et al. (2015) point out that the degree of mass segregation depends on how it is
measured in simulations and compared to observations.
It can conveniently be computed using the method of Allison et al. (2009a,b), which is
based on the minimum spanning tree (Gower and Ross 1969). Kirk et al. (2014) showed that
small clusters in hydrodynamic simulations exhibit primordial mass segregation with dis-
tributions consistent with nearby, young embedded clusters. Parker et al. (2015) found that
the degree of mass segregation is reduced if the clusters form under the influence of feed-
back from massive stars. Girichidis et al. (2012b) report that the degree of mass segregation
depends on the initial density configuration, but that no inverse mass segregation occurred.
Clusters undergoing competitive accretion are expected to be primordially mass-segregated
(Bonnell et al. 2001, cf. Bate 2009). In all cases the time scales are consistent with dy

\subsection{Age Determination in Upper Scorpius with Eclipsing Binaries}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...872..161D/abstract

While the basic theory of stellar evolution in the pre-main-
sequence (PMS) stage has existed for over 50 yr (e.g.,
Hayashi 1961; Henyey et al. 1965; Iben 1965), direct tests of
these model predictions remain infrequent. Meanwhile, theor-
etical models have evolved from simple hydrostatic contraction
and basic nuclear reaction networks to including the effects of
deuterium burning, protostellar and circumstellar disk accre-
tion, realistic surface boundary conditions, convection, and
magnetic elds or star spots (see D’Antona 2017 for a review).
Our best method of evaluating such models is through detailed
characterization of benchmark PMS stars allowing dynamical
mass determinations from, e.g., circumstellar disk rotation
curves or binary orbit determination through either astrometry
or spectroscopy (Hillenbrand & White 2004; Mathieu et al.
2007). The most stringent tests are provided by double-lined
eclipsing binaries (EBs). For these systems, absolute dimen-
sions and masses can be directly measured in a distance-
independent manner with minimal theoretical assumptions and
precisions approaching 1% (see Andersen 1991; Torres et al.
2010 for reviews). Thus, PMS EBs allow for direct measure-
ment of the contraction timescales (i.e., PMS lifetimes) of stars.
To date, relatively few PMS EBs have been discovered and
characterized. Stassun et al. (2014) provided a review of PMS
EBs and a careful assessment of how their parameters compare

with predictions from stellar evolution models, clearly indicat-
ing systematic inaccuracies in the current generation of models.
Since that work, several new PMS EBs have been added and
evolution models have been updated.
A sizable chapter of stellar astrophysics is dependent on the
calibration of PMS evolution models. For example, the
inability of current models to match the observed colors and
luminosities of stars less massive than the Sun translates
directly into uncertainties in the initial mass function, perhaps
the most fundamental relation in stellar astrophysics and our
most salient clue toward understanding how stars form (Bastian
et al. 2010). Other foundational relationships in stellar
astrophysics, such as age–activity–rotation relations (Barnes
et al. 2005; Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008; Meibom et al.
2015), are calibrated to clusters and other coeval stellar
populations, the ages of which depend on evolutionary models.
Likewise, the timescale for protoplanetary disk dispersal and
thus giant planet formation is tied to the age scale of young
clusters and star-forming regions, which are age-dated using
PMS evolution models (Haisch et al. 2001; Hillenbrand 2005;
Mamajek 2009).

6.5. Evaluating the Accuracy of PMS Models
We have so far compared the ages implied for our sample of
binaries in both the MRD and the HRD. Now, using our
binaries as benchmarks, we take a critical look at the accuracy
and predictive power of PMS models. First, we examine
masses derived from a theoretical HRD and compare them with
our dynamically measured masses. For PMS stars, it has long
been known that models predict masses that are 10%–30%
lower than dynamical measurements (Hillenbrand & White
2004). In Figure 22, we show the trends in the fractional errors
in model-derived masses for various model sets. The general
shapes of most of these curves are indeed quite similar to those
seen in Figure 5 of Hillenbrand & White (2004); namely,
discrepancies become gradually worse as the stellar mass
declines below 1  M (HD 144548 Bab), with the most drastic
offsets occurring near 0.3  M (UScoCTIO 5), before improv-
ing substantially toward 0.1  M (EPIC 203710387). The
PARSEC v1.2S models and spotted SP15 models provide
two clear exceptions to this trend. These models overpredict
mass by 30%–300% in the 0.1–0.3  M range.
The models that are most accurate at predicting masses from
the HRD are the Feiden (2016) magnetic models, followed by
the MIST models. However, both of these model sets still
predict masses that are occasionally 25% too low or too high.
The PARSEC models exhibit some of the largest systematic
offsets between model-derived masses and dynamical masses. The v1.0 and v1.1 iterations of these models underpredict
masses by 40%, while the PARSEC v1.2S models over-
predict the masses of EPIC 203710387 AB by∼300%. The
earlier versions of these models do not extend to temperatures
low enough to test the accuracy for this ultra-low-mass system.

Model systematics.Few models are able to reproduce the
exact slope of the mass–radius relation of Upper Sco EBs
with a single age. The PARSEC v1.2S models, for
example, exhibit some of the most serious systematic
offsets, which are likely the result of the ad hoc
adjustment of the surface boundary conditions for low-
mass stars in those models. As such, the older age implied
by the PARSEC v1.2S models is not credible. On the
other hand, the SP15 models are the most successful at
reproducing the data, predicting an age of 5 Myr for the
spot-free case or 7 Myr for the 50% spotted case.
However, we note that those models also produce
unrealistically old ages for the lowest-mass system in
the HRD

\subsection{Masses and Implications for Ages of Low-mass Pre-main-sequence Stars in Taurus and
Ophiuchus}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884...42S/abstract

The mass of a star is its most fundamental parameter and
governs its life from formation to end. As a broad outline,
astronomers traditionally determine the masses of stars in two
ways: by location on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HRD)
with reference to theoretical models of stellar evolution, and
gravitationally by analyzing the orbits of binary stars. HRD-
tting is reliable for stars on the main sequence where the
accuracy of the theoretical models has been well established. In
fact, the HRD- tting approach on the main sequence owes its
success to the many masses of binary stars determined from
their orbital motion.
The HRD is the fundamental tool for the analysis of main-
sequence (MS) stars and of their evolution away from the MS
because it provides a template on which large numbers of stars
can be studied together. Astronomers therefore also want to use
the HRD to determine the masses and ages of very young stars
in clusters and associations where star and planet formation are
occurring. However, divergence among the theoretical models
has been an obstacle to performing this reliably. Frustratingly,
differences among the models have been the most pronounced
for stars of greatest interest in star-forming regions, with
masses <1.5 Meand age <10 MY (Simon et al. 2013). As a
result, astronomers’ understanding of the earliest stages of star
and planet formation is incomplete. This is a serious limitation
because at least one planet associated with a pre-main-sequence
(PMS) star, CI Tau b, is already known (Johns-Krull et al. 2016;
Flagg et al. 2019). However, there is now much greater agreement
among recent models of PMS evolution. For stellar masses
0.5 Meand age >1 Myr the models of Baraffe et al. (2015),
Modules for Experiments in Astrophysics, MESA (Paxton et al.
2015; Choi et al. 2016) and the nonmagnetic models of Feiden
(2016), are in excellent agreement (Simon & Toraskar 2017).

The main result of this work was the identi cation of a sample
of stars with accurate and precise masses and comparison of
these stars’ dynamical masses with masses measured from
models of PMS evolution to assess the accuracy of mass
estimates from the HRD only. To this end, we culled our sample
of 39 stars in the Taurus SFR and 6 in the Ophiuchus SFR with
masses measured by rotation of their circumstellar disk to 29
stars in Taurus and 3 in Ophiuchus, with dynamical mass, Mdyn,
good to at least 10%. We placed these on HRDs using models of
PMS evolution with and without internal magnetic elds.
We found that:
(1) In the mass range∼0.4–1.4 Me, models of PMS evolution
that do not include internal magnetic elds (“standard”
models) underestimate the actual stellar mass by about 30%.
(2) Track masses estimated using an HRD with magnetic
evolutionary tracks reproduce the actual masses much
more closely. The average difference between the
dynamical mass and track mass is 0.01±0.02 Me.
(3) Given this agreement between the dynamical and
magnetic track masses, results inferred for both masses
and ages using the magnetic tracks are likely more
reliable than those derived from the standard tracks.
(4) Ages of the stars in the Taurus SFR evaluated using
isochrones of the magnetic models are older,∼3–10 MY,
than the 1–3 MY range inferred using the standard model.
The broad age range is principally the result of
uncertainties in the stellar luminosities.
(5) The older ages increase the timescale for the formation of
giant gas planets and their possible migration to orbits
very near the host stars where they appear as the hot
Jupiters. The longer timescales also favor the chemical
evolution of the massive disks in which the planets form.
We believe that our results are suf ciently secure to
recommend the use of magnetic models of stellar evolution
to estimate the masses of low-mass PMS stars when dynamical
masses are not available. To improve on this work, two
advances are necessary. The sample with which we worked has

For each OC we wish to study, we perform a cone search on Gaia DR3 data to obtain data for sources in the sky vicinity of the OC. The cone search is centred on the mean sky position of the OC members, for which we use the values reported by Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020) and Castro-Ginard et al. (2022). To determine the angular size of the cone search, we use an angular radius that corresponds to a projected physical radius of 50 pc at the location of the OC. This choice is based on the observa- tion that OC cores are often surrounded by a halo or corona of comoving stars (Meingast et al. 2021; Tarricq et al. 2022), which we want to include in our query.

Then, we use the formulas AG =2.74 × E(B − V), E(BP−RP)=1.339 × E(B −V), and E(G − RP) = 0.705 × E(B − V ) (Casagrande & Vanden- Berg 2018; Zhong et al. 2019) to calculate the E(B − V ) values. Figure 6 shows the isochrone-fitting examples for four clusters and the final fitting results (age: log t; distance modulus: m – M;
reddening value: E(B − V )) are shown in Table 2.

To describe better the radial density profile (RDP) of clusters with extended outer regions, it is proposed by Zhong2022 to use a two-component model instead of only using a King model (King 1962, 1966). After deriving the RDP of each cluster through a two-dimensional Gaussian KDE on the two- dimensional position space, we further attempted the two- component model to fit the RDP:
F(r) = f (r) + g(r), (1) % https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac77fa/pdf
where f (r) is the King model that mainly describes the RDP of core members and g(r) is a logarithmic Gaussian function that described the RDP of corona members (Zhong2022).
In the fitting procedure, the two-component model performs a more reliable approximation of the RDP of most OCSN clusters. In particular, we noted that there are about 33\% of OCSN clusters whose RDPs can be well approximated by the single King model. The fraction of clusters that well follow a single King profile is larger than the fraction (about 10\%) in Zhong2022. We speculate that it is because the outer extended structure of some nearby clusters can be extended to dozens of degrees, and the OCSN clusters we identified may still be core components. However, there is still a fraction of star clusters (43 of 324) that cannot be decently fitted by the single-component or two-component method, possibly due to their sparse distribution, extended tail-like structures, or even multiple cores. And it is quite obvious that not all of the OCSN clusters have a clear core.

First, we queried a cone of 50 pc radius around the center of each cluster. Then, we used the cluster disper- sion in proper motion from CAN+20 to perform cuts at 10σ in proper motion to discard very discrepant stars and help the clus- tering algorithm. We also considered only stars with G < 18 mag and with a renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) lower than 1.4, following the recommendation of Fabricius et al. (2021). Finnally, for clusters closer than 500 pc, which span a very wide area on the sky, we applied an additional cut in parallax in order to limit the number of stars in the query. Based on πcluster, the mean parallax of CAN+20, we left a margin of 200 pc so that all the stars with parallaxes π verifying the following relation were selected: 1/πcluster − 200 pc < 1/π < 1/πcluster + 200 pc.
For each cluster, these cuts allowed us to discard a significant number of stars whose astrometric measurements were inconsis- tent with the mean astrometric parameters of the cluster.

Last, we have applied the El-Badry et al. (2021) correction to
the parallax error for stars with G-magnitudes in the range of
7 <G <21 mag.

We removed sources for which, in 10% of the cases, more
than one peak was identified in the windows used by Gaia
(ipd_frac_multi_peak). This could imply that the source
may be a visually resolved double star. This leaves 4548 sources.
– We excluded sources for which the visibility periods
(visibility_periods_used) used were 9 or less, possibly
indicating that the astrometric parameters (such as the par-

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...954..134K/abstract

Alternative cuts using the renormalized unit weight error
(RUWE) have recently become popular for vetting astrometric
solutions in place of the cut for u, particularly the requirement
that RUWE < 1.4 (Lindegren 2018). This cut is most often
used speci cally to identify probable binaries (Bryson et al.
2020), and while binaries do provide challenges to youth
assessment, they are also a core component of all young
associations, and are included in our model of the solar
neighborhood introduced in Section 3. The requirement that
RUWE < 1.4 is also more than twice as restrictive as the cut on
u, removing over 3.3 million stars out of the 54 million that
exist before the astrometric cut. Furthermore, recent work by
Fitton et al. (2022) has shown that RUWE is also increased by
the presence of protoplanetary disks, which are a common
feature of young associations. We, therefore, conclude that the
possible quality improvements thatov this RUWE cut provide
do not justify the detrimental effects on the completeness of
young populations, particularly at the youth probability
calculation stage. We, therefore, do not apply this restriction
for the initial selection of stars. Applying this cut is however
useful for improving our detection of young associations in
velocity space, a choice that we discuss in Section 4.1.
Inequality (3) provides an additional quality check on
parallax speci cally, with a more permissive limit of 5
compared to the value of 10 chosen in SPYGLASS-I. This
looser restriction is common in papers using Gaia data (e.g.,
Arenou et al. 2018; Katz et al. 2019), and its use re ects
improvements made in Section 3.2, which greatly improve our
handling of parallax uncertainties. While additional restrictions
related to distance uncertainty will be necessary for identifying
young groups, further parallax restrictions are no longer
required for accurate assessments of youth. Finally, we dropped
the requirement that visibility_periods_
used > 8
used in SPYGLASS-I, as no stars fail that restriction in Gaia
DR3. Stars that passed these quality restrictions were admitted
to the main quality-restricted data set we used for analysis,
which contains nearly 53 million stars within 1 kpc.

DISTANCES 

While inverting Gaia parallaxes provides an accurate
distance measurement in the near eld, when expanding our
search to a distance of 1 kpc the uncertainties in these
measurements become much more signi cant and asymme-
trical, reducing the accuracy of this distance calculation method. To improve these results, Bailer-Jones et al. (2021)
use a series of priors to re ne the distance measurements
relative to results from raw Gaia parallaxes. This work provides
both geometric distances, which use a direction-dependent
prior in addition to Gaia parallaxes, and photogeometric
distances, which include an additional color–magnitude prior
that favors distances that produce positions in color–magnitude
space consistent with expectations. Both of these measurement
methods have been shown to produce a robust improvement
over inverted parallaxes, especially for sources with larger
fractional uncertainties (Lutz & Kelker 1973; Bailer-Jones et al.
2021). We experimented with both distance calculation
methods, running our full young star identi cation pipeline
and HDBSCAN clustering routine on both data sets. We found
limited visually identi able differences between the two, with
locally larger radial scatter in the photogeometric distances for
some associations. While these differences were very subtle,
we selected the geometric distances for the purposes of this
project, despite the higher accuracy of the photogeometric
distances reported in Bailer-Jones et al. (2021). Since our
detection of young stars is based on a Bayesian framework that
uses distances and magnitudes, the use of distances with their
own priors on magnitude may introduce undesired artifacts.
This suspicion appears to be re ected in the subtly wider scatter
in some associations during our testing, which may be the
result of reddening anomalies manipulating and distorting the
priors for the Bailer-Jones et al. (2021) photogeometric
distances. Since both reddening and photometric youth are
likely to skew generalized photometric priors, it would not be
surprising to see less accurate photogeometric distances in
these environments despite their higher accuracy relative to
geometric distances across the rest of the sky.

A trustworthy assessment of the clusters’ age and distance depends

Knowing cluster size is a substantial issue to investigate the cluster’s
dynamic evolution through an irregular shape of the cluster in the
Milky Way Galaxy. It’s hard to determine the precise cluster center and
radial extent. Cluster radius estimation is one of the most significant
basic parameters, (Bisht et al., 2020). The cluster center is taken at
the most over-condensation area of the cluster region. Subsequently,
using Gaia DR3 data, we divided the area of the cluster into equal-
sized bins in ����&������ and counted the stars in each bin. The mean and
median values have been estimated to both ���� & ������. We found that,
they are almost agree with Dias et al. (2014), as reported in Table 3. We
determined the radial stellar density profile (RDP) by estimating stellar
density in concentric circular rings centered at the cluster center. The
number of stars in each annular region is counted, (Joshi et al., 2012).
The density in the �� zone is then ���� =����∕����, where ���� and ���� are the
star number and the area of the �� zone, respectively. The error bars
are derived by supposing that the number of stars in an area follows
the Poisson error. The limited radius �������� could be estimated to cover
the entire cluster region and reaches a sufficient stability, where the
members’ stars melted in the field ones, (Tadross and Hendy, 2021b).
Therefore, �������� was calculated according to the following formula
of Bukowiecki et al. (2011), we can get the boundary radius by applying
the equation:
�������� =����√����
−1 (1)

where ������ is the uncertainty of the ���� value. So, the estimated radius of
such cluster is just the minimum radial range of the cluster, (Maurya

where ����, ����, and ���� are the background field density, central star
density, and the core radius of the cluster, which defined as the radial
distance from the center where the stellar density ��(��) becomes half
of its central value ���� respectively. The estimated values of structural
parameters are reported in Table 1 for all the clusters. The stellar
density distributions for the studied clusters are shown in Fig. 7 where
the solid red curves refer to the King profile. The clusters center has
been taken from Dias’ catalog, (Dias et al., 2014). Furthermore, the
tidal radius of the cluster ���� is the distance from the core of the cluster,
whereas the effect of gravity on the Galaxy is equal to the core of the
cluster. By the overall masses calculation of such clusters, the tidal
radius can be estimated by using Jeffries et al. (2001) equation as
follows:
���� =1.46×(����)

where ���� and ���� are the tidal radius (in parsec) and the total mass
of the cluster (in solar mass). According to Peterson and King (1975),

4.3. Velocity-Luminosity Relation
If the mass segregation effects solely result from the process of
two-body relaxation and the associated energy equipartition, one
should find some evidence for this effect not only in the spatial
distribution of the cluster members, but also in their velocity dis-
tribution: the more massive members will have a smaller velocity
dispersion than the less massive stars.
Accordingly, for true cluster members (with p 0:95) in dif-
ferent magnitude ranges, the intrinsic proper-motion dispersions 2
int, as derived from the observed dispersions obs, and the mean
errors intrinsic to the stellar proper motions were investigated.
The final results are shown in Figures 9 and 10. It can be seen
from these figures that the intrinsic proper-motion dispersions
are not significantly different for various magnitude groups. Thus,
our data do not support any significant velocity (dispersion)—
mass correlation, in either NGC 2244 or NGC 6530 (see also Zhao
et al. 2006).

\subsection{Diagnosing the Stellar Population and Tidal Structure of the Blanco 1 Star Cluster}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889...99Z/abstract

A cluster with a high level of mass segregation often is
readily discernible in the density pro le (Hillenbrand 1997;
Wang et al. 2014), or the MF inside different annuli (Pang et al.
2013; Tang et al. 2019). These methods, nonetheless, are
effective only when a large number of stars are segregated.

Gouliermis et al. (2004) reported different levels of mass
segregation among the young clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud via the two methods mentioned above with different number of mass bins, and with
different bin sizes. 

Alternatively, we adopted the Λ method based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm developed by Allison et al. (2009a). An application of the Λ method to quantify the level of mass segregation in a young star cluster can be found in Pang et al. (2013). In brief, the Λ method compares the average distance among the N most massive members (lmassive) of the cluster, to that of the N random members (lnormal). If lmassive is smaller, the cluster is mass segregated to its Nth
massive stars. Note that the distance between each pair of stars
is calculated by the MST method, and lnormal is the average
length of 100 random sets. The signi cance of the mass
segregation, parameterized as the“the mass segregation ratio”
(ΛMSR) is de ned (Allison et al. 2009a) as

As a consequence of energy equipartition in two-body
encounters, mass segregation occurs faster among (fewer) more
massive stars, and proceeds toward lower masses as a star
cluster ages. The time for a cluster to segregate (tseg) down to mass M is (Spitzer 1987; Allison et al. 2009b; Pang et al.

\subsection{New Insights into the Structure of Open Clusters in the Gaia Era}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...54Z/abstract

Considering the
typical size for most giant molecular clouds of about 200 pc,
we adopt the searching radius of cluster members with 100 pc, to cover the whole molecular cloud region in which cluster
members may have formed. For clusters with a distance
between 1000 and 2000 pc, the corresponding angular
searching radius is from 5° . 7 to 2° . 8.


A spatial density pro le is a common tool to reveal the
structure of star clusters and is also used for cluster size
determination (Camargo et al. 2012; Sung et al. 2013). In
general, considering most of dense star clusters present
approximate symmetrical structures, their spatial density pro le
can be dimensionally reduced to the radial density pro le
(RDP). To describe the RDP of a star cluster, the King (1962)
model is widely used for approximation of this kind of stellar
distribution. Although the King model is an empirical density
law derived from the RDP of globular clusters, it is still a good
approximation function and is widely used for describing the
RDP of many open clusters. The pro le is described as:

where k is a constant, rc and rt are the core and tidal radius,
respectively. If r = rt, the star density of cluster members is
equal to zero, which means there are no cluster members
outside this region. If r ? rc, the star density of cluster
members tends to be constant and is often considered to be
approximately equal to the density of surrounding eld stars
(Kharchenko et al. 2013; Seleznev 2016; Qin et al. 2021). In
general, the ratio of rt/rc is of the order of 10 in most open
cluster and the mean core radius is rc
= 1.8 pc (Kharchenko
et al. 2013). Obviously, in the traditional study of the clusters,
as the RDP tting is mainly focused on a limited spatial area
(usually within a few dozen pc) and with a higher density than
surrounding eld stars, the approximation of King’s pro le
could usually perform a satisfactory description.
However, in the Gaia era, because of the great improvement
in astrometric data quality, more and more extended structures
with large spatial distribution in the cluster were discovered

(e.g., Röser & Schilbach 2019; Zhong et al. 2019; Zhang et al.
2020; Tarricq et al. 2022). We now know that, for some open
clusters, their member stars do not only include the core
component but also the outer halo (or corona) component. As
the outer halo members present a much more extended
distribution than the core members, understanding of the
structure and boundary of a cluster should be signi cantly
changed. Moreover, although the number density of halo
components is lower than the core components, a large spatial
distribution of them could even provide a 10 times larger
number of members than the core stars (Kholopov 1969).
Considering that the outer halo members are also an important
part of the cluster, their contribution to the cluster structure
parameters can no longer be ignored.

It should be noted that for most clusters, the modi ed RDP
can be divided into two parts: the inner part with small radial
dispersion, and the outer part with great radial dispersion. This
is because the distribution of core members in the inner region
is usually dense and spherical symmetry (similar to the globular
cluster distribution), while the distribution of density contours
in the outer region is often asymmetric and presents a much
gentler gradient. After adding the outer halo members in the
cluster RDP, we note that the King model does not reproduce
the modi ed RDP very well: (1) the rt will be derived to a very
large value (thousands of degrees) for some clusters, which is
no longer represent a physical concept as King model
described; (2) the overall tting result often present a large
deviation both in the inner and the outer region.
Further analysis shows that the observed RDP can be divided
into two parts: the inner part with dense distribution, which can
be well tted by the traditional King model, and the outer part
with extended distribution, which reveals a large deviation with
the King pro le. It is noted that, Danilov & Putkov (2012) also
found that the single King pro le tends to underestimate the
number of stars and proposed a two-component model for the RDP of the open clusters. In addition to the cluster core,
the corona model of a uniform sphere was constructed by
Danilov & Putkov (2012), and the surface density distribution
of clusters is approximated by a two-component model
(Seleznev 2016). Keeping these studies in mind, to perform a
better description of the modi ed RDP, we assume that the core
region is composed of core members that are still consistent
with the King model, and the outer region is composed of two
components dominating with outer halo members. The two
component model F(r) for approximation of the modi ed RD
is
F r f r g r ,
where f (r) is the King model in Equation (1), and g(r) is a
logarithmic Gaussian function that describes the RDP of outer
halo members. In the outer region (r >rc), the RDP of outer
halo members is
 ( ) · ( )
g r e 
where ρ, μ, and σ are the free parameters for tting.
According to the Danilov et al. (2014) analysis of corona
dynamics of the open clusters, corona stars move along orbits
close to periodic retrograde orbits, which may make the radial
component of corona star velocity distribution close to zero.
This means that the corona stars follow a spherical distribution
and do not pass through the core of the cluster. We use the
logarithmic Gaussian function to describe the RDP of the outer
halo component, which also proves that the outer halo
component has a spherical layer structure.
For ln (r)= μ, the g(r)= ρ, represents the maximum number
density of outer halo members. We de ne the radius
ro
= r00· e μ as the mean size of the cluster’s outer region,
where r00 = 1°. Around this place, for most of the clusters with
outer halo components, the major component of cluster
members has changed from core members to outer halo
members. For comparison, within the cluster core radius rc, the
main component is the core members. In order to determine the
boundary of star clusters, we de ne a radius re
= r00· e μ+3 σ
,
which contains the majority of cluster members and can be
considered as the boundary of the cluster. If r = re, then
g(r)= ρ· e−9/2, and the number density fraction is reduced to
about 1% of the maximum density of outer halo members,
which also means >99.7% outer halo members and∼100%
core members are included within the re.

To provide reliable characteristic radii of open clusters, we
plot the RDP of each cluster and check the tting result by eye.
Although most open clusters (229 in 256) present the properties
of the two components in their RDP tting, some of them (27
in 256) only present single-component properties that can be
approximately tted by the King model. This means that the
outer halo components of these clusters may have been stripped
away by various internal and external factors in evolution, or
they are not detected by us because they have a more extended

\subsection{A Gaia EDR3 search for tidal tails in disintegrating open clusters}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3525B/abstract


A known effect of distance estimation from parallax measurements
(required for conversion to the Galactocentric coordinate system) is
that the morphology of star clusters appears to be stretched along
the line of sight when distances are obtained by simple parallax
inversion (e.g. Pang et al. 2021). This effect becomes more prominent
with increasing cluster distance. To mitigate this issue, we use the
photogeometric distances to our cluster members for Gaia EDR3 as
found by Bailer-Jones et al. (2021). They estimate stellar distances
following a probabilistic approach using a prior constructed from a
3D model of the Galaxy, taking into account interstellar extinction,
the Gaia variable magnitude limit, and the colour and apparent
magnitude of each star.

4.2 Minimum spanning tree and mass segregation classes
While the deviation of the mass function slope from the Salpeter
value is an indicator of mass segregation, the degree of mass segre-
gation can be quantified in open clusters following the prescription
by Allison et al. (2009), which utilizes minimum spanning trees
(MSTs3). The method calculates the mass segregation ratio (λMSR)
of a cluster by comparing the length of the MST (lmassive) of the
most massive members (numbering Nmassive), with the length of the
MST of a set of the same number of randomly chosen member stars
(lrandom). λMSR is thus described by the following equation:
λMSR(Nmassive)=
< lrandom >
lmassive
σ(lrandom)
where < lrandom > and σ(lrandom) refer to the mean and standard
deviation of lrandom calculated in N random samples of cluster
members. In this work, we sample Nmassive random cluster members N
= 100 times. Only those cluster members brighter than G= 18.5 mag
are sampled to avoid completeness issues (see Appendix A for
details). The λMSR value thus calculated varies with the chosen
Nmassive value. If a cluster is mass segregated, its λMSR value would
be greater than 1, with the value increasing with higher degrees of
mass segregation. If more cluster members feel the effect of mass
segregation, then λMSR value would remain greater than 1 for higher
Nmassive values.
We calculate the λMSR values for each of the 46 clusters studied
in this work, limiting the Nmassive value to the number of cluster
members brighter than G= 14 mag (this generally covers 3–4 mag
below the brightest most massive member even in the most distant
clusters in our sample) up to a maximum Nmassive = 100. We find that
the λMSR versus Nmassive profiles of the open clusters can be visually
classified into four general classes (noted in Table 3). An example
of a cluster for each of these classes is shown in Fig. 12, and we
describe each class as follows:
(i) Class 1: The λMSR value is low (generally below 1) for small
Nmassive values but increases with increasing Nmassive values remaining
above 1 (including the 1 σ uncertainty) till the maximum measured
Nmassive value. NGC 6475 is such a cluster whose λMSR versus Nmassive
profile is shown in Fig. 12. There are three clusters in our sample
that show such profiles, three of which have tidal tails. The mass
segregation effect seems to be felt for the largest number of cluster
members.
(ii) Class 2: The λMSR value is close to its highest value for small
Nmassive values but then decreases with increasing Nmassive values.
However, the λMSR value eventually plateaus to a value above 1
(including the 1 σ uncertainty) till the maximum measured Nmassive
value. NGC 6940 is such a cluster whose λMSR versus Nmassive profile
is shown in Fig. 12. There are 16 clusters in our sample that show
such profiles, five of which have tidal tails. As for Class 1 clusters,
the mass segregation effect seems to be felt for a large number of
cluster members.
(iii) Class 3: As for Class 2 clusters, the λMSR value is close
to its highest value for small Nmassive values but then decreases
with increasing Nmassive values. However, the λMSR value eventually
plateaus to a value around 1 (including the 1 σ uncertainty) till
the maximum measured Nmassive value. NGC 7243 is such a cluster
whose λMSR versus Nmassive profile is shown in Fig. 12. There are 19
clusters in our sample that show such profiles, seven of which have
tidal tails. The mass segregation effect seems to be felt only for the
most massive cluster members.
(iv) Class 4: These clusters show λMSR values around 1 (including
the 1σ uncertainty) for nearly all measured Nmassive values.
Teutsch 35 is such a cluster whose λMSR versus Nmassive profile is
shown in Fig. 12. There are five clusters in our sample that show
such profiles, all of which have tidal tails. These clusters do not
show mass segregation.
It is not clear whether Class 1 or Class 2 host the most mass-
segregated clusters, but broadly speaking, they have the clusters
where the mass segregation effect is experienced by most members.
Class 3 clusters have mass segregation for just the most massive
members while Class 4 clusters are non-mass segregated. It is
intriguing that all Class 4 clusters in this work host tidal tails.
One may naively interpret that there is a 78.27 ± 21.72 per cent
probability (95 per cent binomial confidence interval calculated for
finding all five clusters with tidal tails) that all non-mass segregated
clusters have tidal tails. Since such a scenario is unlikely for all
non-mass segregated clusters, we speculate that our initial selection
of elongated clusters in 2D space (Section 2) is responsible for
preferentially selecting only those non-mass segregated clusters with
tidal tails. It is possible that an elongated cluster that is not mass
segregated would only seem elongated because of its tidal tails
while elongated clusters that are mass segregated would have a more
populated halo of lower mass stars whose 2D spatial distribution may
appear elongated. Thus all five Class 4 clusters hosting tidal tails mayDeciphering Star Cluster Evolution by Shape Morphology
just stem from our initial selection of elongated clusters, implying
that such a selection of non-mass segregated clusters would yield a
78.27 ± 21.72 per cent probability of such clusters having tidal tails.

2.2. Correcting distances through Bayesian parallax
inversion
Several studies (see, e.g., Smith & Eichhorn 1996; Bailer-Jones
2015; Luri et al. 2018; Carrera et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020)
have shown that the morphology of open clusters appears to be
stretched along the line of sight

% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...687A.291H/abstract


Before calculating the 3D spatial coordinates of the sam-
ple’s member stars by the Astropy package, we also have to
correct the distance of these members. Due to the symme-
try of observational errors in Gaia measuring parallaxes (see,
e.g., Bailer-Jones 2015; Luri et al. 2018; Carrera et al. 2019;
Zhang et al. 2020), distance errors become an asymmetric distri-
bution function by directly inverting these Gaia measuring par-
allaxes, 1/ϖ. Therefore, their 3D spatial distributions appear to
be stretched along the line of sight. The distance problem is alle-
viated within the Bayesian framework (e.g., Bailer-Jones 2015;
Carrera et al. 2019; Pang et al. 2021; Ye et al. 2021; Qin et al.
2023a; Hu et al. 2023). By this approach, Carrera et al. (2019)
has corrected members’ distances of NGC 2682, located at about
860 pc from the Sun (Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018). The princi-
ple equations for the Bayesian distance correction are listed in
Appendix A.2.

This work is based on the biggest census catalog of open clus-
ters and their member star catalogs from Gaia-DR3

2. The results indicate that there is an anticorrelation of the
ER of sample clusters with the number of their members, imply-
ing that the sample clusters with a vast number of members may
have much more elliptical external shape than internal morphol-
ogy. In addition, the result of a slight shrinking of the MD of the
sample clusters with the members’ number hints that the self-
gravitational binding of the sample clusters plays a significant
role in maintaining their morphological stability

Based on the parameters derived from the RDP fitting,
we also calculate the density-contrast (δc) parameter that
quantifies how compact the cluster is. According Bonatto &
Bica (2009), this parameter is given by
δc = 1 + σ0
σbg
, (3)
where compact clusters are expected to have 7 < δc < 23.

Based on the mass M and radius R adopted for the
cluster, we used the expression Tcr = 10(R3/GM)1/2 to es-
timate the crossing time. The ratio of cluster age to crossing
time is used to quantify the dynamical age expressed by the
parameter Π. According to Gieles & Portegies Zwart (2011),
the expanding objects have Π <1 and can be distinguished
from bound star clusters with Π >1.

5.4 Distribution of massive stars
Analysing the properties of the massive star as a function of
age, surface density, and structure is useful in order to un-
derstand better the origin and evolution of mass segregation

of stellar clusters (e.g. Dib et al. 2018; Maurya et al. 2020;
Kim et al. 2021; Nony et al. 2021)
In this section, we discuss two forms to quantify if mas-
sive stars are concentrated (or not) in a projected distribu-
tion by calculating the mass segregation ratio (ΛMSR) and
plotting the local surface density (Σ) as a function of mass.
The parameter ΛMSR (Allison et al. 2009) is used to de-
termine if massive stars are closer to each other. It is defined
by:
⟨laverage⟩
ΛMSR =
, (4)
lsubset
where ⟨laverage⟩is the average (median) length of the MST
measured for sets of NMST random stars, and lsubset is the
same measure made for the subset of NMST most massive
stars. In this work, we use a subset of NMST = 10. We
adopted the standard deviation from the dispersion associ-
ated with the roughly Gaussian distribution around ⟨laverage⟩
to represent the uncertainty on the estimate of the mass seg-
regation ratio. The cases of mass segregation are indicated
by ΛMSR > 1.
Another parameter to be considered is ΣLDR, com-
monly used to indicate if the massive stars are in regions
of higher surface density than those where low-mass stars
are found. The calculation of the local stellar surface den-
sity (Maschberger & Clarke 2011) for an individual star iis
expressed by:
N−1
Σi =
, (5)
πr2
i,N
where ri,N is the distance between a given star and its Nth
nearest neighbour. In this work, we set N = 10. Following
Parker et al. (2014), we adopted the local density ratio:

where
Σsubset is the average measured for a given subset
˜
of stars, and
Σall corresponds to the average calculated for
all the stars of the cluster. If the subset contains massive
stars concentrated in dense regions, its local surface density
is expected to be higher than the whole sample. In this case,
the mass segregation is indicated by ΣLDR > 1. With this
method, it is possible to quantify if massive stars are found
in dense regions, which is different from the mass segregation
measured by ΛMSR (Parker et al. 2014; Parker & Goodwin
2015).
Following the same method to infer the standard devi-
ation of RP50 (see Sect. 5.1), the ΣLDR uncertainties were
estimated using the bootstrap technique (Efron 1979). The
method creates a simulated data set considering a varia-
tion of each parameter (positions) within a confidence level
corresponding to a given distribution. Then, the standard
deviation of this set of values is calculated.
An example of the results of ΛMSR and Σ compared with
the mass distribution is shown in Fig. 8. The parameters
related to the fractal statistics and the geometric structure
of the clusters are given in Table 4. The resulting ΣLDR,
obtained from the ratio of the values corresponding to the
horizontal lines in Fig. 8 (right panel) shows that our clusters
tend not to have massive stars concentrated in regions of
high surface density, which is indicated by ΣLDR ∼1.
Aiming to quantify the significance of the deviation
from the median for all stars, we calculate the p-values using
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the cumulative distribution
of the radial distances from the center of all stars and the
10 most massive stars. Following Parker & Goodwin (2015),
we adopted a p-value < 0.1 as the significance threshold.
If ΣLDR ∼1 and p-value > 0.1, the distributions show no
significant difference, indicating that the most massive stars
are not mass segregated. This is confirmed for Mrk38a,b
and NGC 2659a,b. However, Col205 and NGC 3532 are too
close to the adopted threshold, making it difficult to gauge
whether the differences are significant. On the other hand,
for IC 2602, NGC 2168, and NGC 6494, the parameters
ΣLDR > 2 and p-value < 0.1 are clear signature of mass
segregation.
In particular for NGC 6494, Tarricq et al. (2022) found
mass segregation ratio ΛMST = 1.37 that is lower than our
result but still compatible (see Table 4 and Fig. B8).

Relation to Cluster Dynamics}

5.3. Mass Segregation
Mass segregation is commonly found in embedded clusters
and young star clusters and can be a consequence of internal
dynamical relaxation, violent relaxation, or primordial mass
segregation (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998; Allison et al.
2009; Pang et al. 2013; Pavlík et al. 2019). The youngest
cluster in our targets, NGC 2232, does not manifest any
evidence of mass segregation, based on measurements of the
mean mass in different annuli (Pang et al. 2020). Two
intermediate-age clusters in our sample, however, do show
mass segregation. Coma Berenices shows evidence of mass
segregation that was quanti ed by comparing the mass
distributions in different annuli (Tang et al. 2018), and
Blanco 1 shows evidence of mass segregation obtained using
the Λ method (Zhang et al. 2020).
The Λ method, developed by Allison et al. (2009), is a tool
to analyze the degree of mass segregation in a star cluster
without the need to determine the cluster center. The Λ method
compares the minimum path length among the Nmassive most
massive members (lmassive) of the cluster to that of the
minimum path length of Nnormal random members (lnormal).
This average minimum path length l is calculated from the
minimum spanning tree (MST) of the sample of stars, which is
obtained using the Python package MiSTree (Naidoo 2019).
When the Nmassive massive stars are segregated, the average
path length for this set of stars, lmassive, is smaller than that for
the set of randomly selected stars (lnormal).
Previous studies have applied the Λ method to star clusters
using the observed 2D positions of stars in the clusters.
Examples include the studies of NGC 3603 in Pang et al.
(2013) and of Blanco 1 in Zhang et al. (2020). However, the 2D
projection can overestimate the degree of segregation by
projecting background stars that are located behind the cluster
center into the inner region. With the distance-corrected 3D
spatial positions of the target cluster members, we are able to
improve the determination of the degree of mass segregation in
3D space. The signi cance of the mass segregation is measured
using the“mass segregation ratio” (ΛMSR, Allison et al. 2009),
which is de ned as
l

L = á ñ 

l l , 2
( )

where σnormal is the standard deviation of the 100 different sets
of lnormal, and 〈lnormal〉 is the average length of 100 random sets.
Figure 13 presents the ΛMSR for the clusters, based on the 3D
and 2D positions of the members in each cluster. As can be
seen from the gure, robust evidence of mass segregation is
found in ve clusters, NGC 2422 (segregated down to 3.6 Me),
NGC 6633 (2.2 Me), NGC 6774 (1.6 Me), Blanco 1 (1.5 Me)

and Coma Berenices (1.1 Me), consistent with previous works
(Prisinzano et al. 2003; Kraus & Hillenbrand 2007; Moraux
et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2018; Yeh et al. 2019). In Coma
Berenices, the most massive stars are not the most concen-
trated; they have likely been expelled from the cluster center
via close encounters with binary stars (e.g., Oh et al. 2015; Oh
& Kroupa 2018). No evidence for mass segregation is found
for the seven other target clusters.
The 2D projected distance will reduce the value of 〈lnormal〉
in Equation (2) by projecting stars that are located farther away
from the cluster center onto the inner region. This will result in
a decrease in ΛMSR. Therefore, the 2D MST will most likely
underestimate the degree of mass segregation in a star cluster
(Figure 13).

\subsection{Young Stellar Objects in the Massive Star-forming Region W49}

To identify the YSOs in W49, we first applied the
Gutermuth et al. (2009) criteria to the 332,442 point sources
in our catalog.

In our analysis of the W49 data we had to take into ac-
count its greater distance and the possible higher level of
contamination from objects such as AGB stars, background
sources, and other extragalactic contaminants that have prob-
ably been classified as YSOs. Since AGB stars are bright and,
in general, slightly bluer than YSOs (Robitaille et al. 2008;
Koenig & Leisawitz 2014), we considered the bright YSOs
that also follow the following selection criteria as candidate
AGB stars:
3 < [3.6] < 9.5 and 0.2 < [3.6]− [4.5] < 1.25
or
3.5 < [3.6] < 9.5 and 0.4 < [3.6]− [8.0] < 2.6
The large cluster of objects at bright magnitudes in
[3.6]− [4.5] versus [3.6] and [3.6]− [8.0] versus [3.6]
color−magnitude diagrams are consistent with being AGB
stars. With this criterion we classified 212 sources as can-
didate AGB stars.

In this study we used the selection method based on
the color and magnitude criteria defined in Gutermuth et al.

YSO candidates. This method is an updated version of that in-
troduced by Gutermuth et al. (2008). Gutermuth et al. (2008,
2009) showed that the Ks-[3.6] vs. [3.6]− [4.5] color−color

classifying YSOs. The J and H bands allow us to further
extend the SED and sort out YSO candidates from highly
reddened main-sequence stars and other background objects.
With the near-IR and Spitzer bands, we can quickly iden-
tify YSO candidates and determine their evolutionary status.
We classify the YSOs into the categories of Class I sources
(protostars with circumstellar disks and infalling envelopes)
and Class II sources (pre-main-sequence stars with optically
thick disks). In addition to these classes, “deeply embedded

significant dust clearing within their disks, can be identified
with this method.

\subsection{On the Determination of Stellar Mass and Binary Fraction of Open Clusters within
500 pc from the Sun}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971...71J/abstract

An open cluster (OC) is a group of coeval stars formed in a
giant molecular cloud in less than 3 Myr (Lada & Lada 2003).
Being single stellar populations, young OCs maintain their initial
stellar formation state within a dozen million years, which are
widely used to study the stellar mass function (Bastian et al.
2010). Although the massive member stars would evolve away
from the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram,
most medium-mass and low-mass member stars are still ideal
tracers for investigating the cluster’s properties, such as the
mass function and mass segregation. The coeval nature of an
OC allows us to determine its members by their clustering in
the position space, the proper motion distribution, and the color–magnitude diagram (CMD; Kharchenko et al. 2005).
Subsequently, one can accurately determine the age and mass of
member stars by adopting the isochrone tting on the CMD. In
addition, all members in an OC share a similar distance and
extinction, whose observability is only affected by intrinsic
brightness. This results in a higher completeness of star counting
within OCs than eld stars.

Bhattacharya et al. (2022) estimated the member
star masses for 46 OCs with extended structure using the Gaia
Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) and tted the mass
functions of their members (>0.5 Me) in the intra-tidal, extra-
tidal, leading tail, and trailing tail for each OC. They found that
most older clusters are usually mass-segregated and present a
atter mass function.

Since cluster members share similar ages and chemical
abundances, the mass of members can be easily determined
from theoretical isochrones (Bergbusch & Vandenberg 1992).

In the Gaia era, it is con rmed
that star clusters generally have an extended structure, while
their physical scales are believed to be approximately
10–100 pc (Zhong et al. 2022). 

Many studies have found that a large number of OCs have
the mass segregation phenomenon (Dib et al. 2018; Dib &
Henning 2019; Hetem & Gregorio-Hetem 2019) in that
compared with low-mass stars, massive stars tend to be
distributed in the central region of the cluster. Mass segregation
is generally believed to result from the dynamic evolution of
clusters. Member stars in the high number density environment
of OCs have a greater probability of interacting with each
other. When two stars encounter or pass by, energy equiparti-
tion causes low-mass stars to strive toward having the same
kinetic energy as high-mass stars. Owing to their lower mass,
they obtain higher velocity and exhibit more signi cant
velocity dispersion, resulting in a more extensive spatial
distribution. Meanwhile, the high-mass stars tend to exhibit
smaller velocity and settle toward the cluster center (Tarricq
2021). However, it is found that some clusters with mass
segregation are much younger than the relaxation time (TE),
which indicates that the dynamic evolution of clusters is not
enough to cause the mass segregation (Chen et al. 2007), so the
observed mass segregation may result from star formation
process or the initial state of giant molecular clouds (Dib et al.
2007, 2010). Hence, the formation mechanism of mass
segregation in star clusters is still controversial (Dib et al.
2018; Plunkett et al. 2018) and requires further research on
more clusters.

To investigate the mass segregation in our sample, we use
0.5 Me as the split point to divide stars into massive and low-
mass parts, and calculate the cumulative number of stars as a
function of ( ) R R
log h , respectively, where R is the radial
distance from the cluster center and the Rh is the half-mass–
radius of the cluster. Furthermore, we employed the index A+
to quantify the degree of mass segregation for each cluster,
which is de ned as the difference in the area between stars
samples with different masses on the cumulative radial
distribution diagram (Alessandrini et al. 2016). For a star
cluster without mass segregation, the spatial distribution of its
massive and low-mass stars is consistent, and A+ tends to 0. If
mass segregation occurs within the star cluster, the massive
stars will concentrate on the cluster’s central region. They will
occupy a larger area on the cumulative radial distribution
diagram compared to the low-mass stars, resulting in a positive
value for A+. We have presented Figure 11 to illustrate the

Figure 12 displays the distribution of mass segregation
parameter A+ as a function of dynamic evolution timescale
( ) T T
log E . For each star cluster, we adopted the ratio of the
cluster age to the relaxation timescale to represent the dynamic
state of the cluster, while the relaxation timescale TE is
calculated by the formula given by Maurya et al. (2020):

where N is the number of member stars and Rh is the cluster’s
half-mass–radius (pc).
¯
m is the average mass of cluster
members (Me). Our sample demonstrates that the degree of
mass segregation rises with the cluster age, indicating that the
dynamic evolution of the cluster mainly causes the mass
segregation

Furthermore, in order to investigate mass segregation during
the initial phase of star cluster formation (McMillan et al. 2007;
Angelo et al. 2019), we selected 28 dynamically young clusters
(corresponding to the top 25% of dynamic age) to verify
whether mass segregation had occurred. Ultimately, we
discovered that 12 clusters demonstrated a positive A+. This
suggests that primordial mass segregation exists in clusters,
although not universally.
We calculated the half-mass–radius Rh and the relaxation
time TE for each cluster and adopted the index A+ to
quantify the degree of mass segregation. Since older
clusters suffered a more dynamic evolution process, the
degree of mass segregation rises with cluster age. In
addition, we also found primordial mass segregation in
young clusters, but this phenomenon is not ubiquitous.

The high accuracy of Gaia data signi cantly improves the
membership determination of OCs. With the help of more
reliable member star identi cation results, more and more
evidence demonstrates that OCs not only have a centralized
core but also present a more extended halo or lamentary
substructure in the outskirts (Meingast & Alves 2019; Zhong
et al. 2019; Röser et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020; Bai et al.
2022). By further research, it is shown that OCs exhibit a
double-component structural feature, consisting of dense core
components (Kings pro le) and extended halo components
(logarithmic Gaussian pro le) (Zhong et al. 2022). It can be
expected that further statistical research on the PDMF of
different components in OCs will provide new insight into the
comprehensive understanding of the formation and evolution
of OCs

\subsection{A Comparative Observational Study of YSO Classi cation
in Four Small Star-forming H II Regions}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...845...21K/abstract

Newly formed YSOs can be detected and classi ed on the
basis of their near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR)
spectral energy distributions (SEDs). As a YSO ages, its
circumstellar environment changes, and this change is re ected
in the shape of its IR SED. For example, very young YSOs (age
2  Myr) will possess optically thick disks, which contribute to
an NIR and MIR emission excess(Strom et al. 1989; Haisch
et al. 2001), while, by an age of∼10 Myr, about 90% of stars
exhibit almost no 3–8 μmNIR emission excess due to the
clearing of the circumstellar disk(Carpenter et al. 2006).
Lada (1987) established a YSO classi cation scheme based
on the appearance of the IR SED. Class I YSOs have rising or
at spectra between 3 and 22 μm, and are thought to be an early
stage associated with the presence of a substantial, infalling,
circumstellar envelope. Class II YSOs have a decreasing SED
in this wavelength range, with emission coming only from an
optically thick circumstellar disk (Lada 1987; Greene et al.
1994). Finally, Class III YSOs are characterized by a very
small infrared excess, and often they cannot be distinguished
from young main-sequence stars on the basis of IR observa-
tions alone. Robitaille et al. (2006) point out that viewing
geometry can sometimes cause the incorrect evolutionary stage
to be associated with an SED class (e.g., an older YSO, with an
optically thick disk, can have a Class I SED if viewed close to
the plane of the disk), but in general the correspondance
between Class I, II, and III IR SED de ned classes and the
increasing age of a YSO holds.
In addition to Class I–III YSOs, there are also YSOs with little
or no NIR excess emission from 1 to 10 μm and large excess
emission beyond 10–20 μm (Strom et al. 1989). These objects,
known as“transition disk” sources, are thought to be YSOs with
a cleared-out inner disk and a truncated, optically thick outer
disk. The ages of the transition disks are uncertain because
plausible origin scenarios for these objects, photoevaporation or
planet formation(D’Alessio et al. 2005), involve different
timescales(Koenig et al. 2012). For example, giant planet
formation could possibly clear the inner part of the disk in the timescale of 5
< Myr(Andrews et al. 2011), but photoevaporation
of the inner disk by the central young star takes place on a longer
timescale(Alexander & Armitage 2009).

YSOs are usually classi ed using procedures involving
either IR spectral indices, or IR colors. The spectral index,
d F d log log a l l= l ( ) ( ), is a measure of the slope of the IR
SED. In a typical spectral index classi cation scheme, the
wavelength range being considered is speci ed, and the various
YSO classes are associated with different ranges of α values. In
schemes using IR colors, the different YSO classes are
associated with various areas on IR color–color and color–
magnitude diagrams, and some procedure for rejecting non-
YSO IR sources is usually employed. For example, Allen et al.
(2004) introduced a method using color–color diagrams to
classify YSOs with Spitzer IRAC data. Later, Gutermuth et al.
(2008) developed a more sophisticated way to classify YSOs
based on the IRAC color–color diagram ([3.6]–[4.5] versus
[5.8]–[8.0]) along with a scheme to eliminate possible
contaminants, which can be easily confused with YSOs.
Koenig et al. (2012) established a YSO color–color classi ca-
tion technique for WISE data based on the Gutermuth et al.
(2008) procedure, and Koenig & Leisawitz (2014) developed a
revised version of this technique, which improved contaminant
rejection and the handling of potential transition disk sources.
Although WISE has lower spatial resolution than Spitzer,
WISE data are available for all Galactic star-forming regions;
therefore, in this paper, we focus on how data from WISE can be
optimally used for the detection and classi cation of YSOs,
especially in cases where visual inspection of a region is a
practical option

Then we selected sources with signal-to-noise
greater than 5 (or ux uncertainty 0.2
< mag) for all bands. Next,
we tried to remove contaminated and/or confused sources by
eliminating WISE objects with photometric contamination and
confusion ags (“D,” “H,” “O,” and“P”) set in any bands. The D
(diffraction spike) ag indicates that the source may be a spurious
detection or contaminated by a diffraction spike from a nearby
bright star. Sources with an H (halo) ag are real sources
contaminated by the scattered halo light surrounding a nearby
bright source, or may be completely spurious detections of
scattered light. Similarly, O (optical ghost) agged sources may
be contaminated by an optical ghost image caused by a nearby
bright source. Finally, P (persistence) agged sources are either
spurious or contaminated due to a short-term latent image left by a
bright source (Wright et al. 2010). The resulting AllWISE sources
that passed the spatial and quality criteria (see Table 2 for the
number for each region) became the input data set for the various
YSO identi cation and classi cation techniques described in the
next section.

After contaminant removal, our YSO classi cation scheme is
identical to Koenig & Leisawitz (2014) except that (1) we only
use data in the WISE bands (therefore the YSO classi cation is
restricted to either the Class I, Class II, Class III, or Transition
disk), and (2) the 2
c and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cuts are
replaced with a visual inspection of the YSO candidates. In
Section 4, we will compare the results of applying the 2
c and
S/N cuts to the results of the visual inspection.
We repeat the relevant YSO classi cation criteria from

Even if the majority of clusters survive for only a few Myr, this is still suﬃcient time
for the cluster environment to influence the properties of member stars. For example, the
radiation field from massive stars may erode accretion disks around pre-main sequence (PMS)
objects (e.g. Johnstone et al. 1998; Adams et al. 2004; De Marchi et al. 2011),

(Hillenbrand & White 2004)?? 
A complete understanding of the star formation process requires the
ability to predict how the properties of young stars depend on their
initial conditions. Despite significant efforts, a key observational
problem remains: the reliable determination of the masses and ages
of the youngest pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars once they become
optically visible, after the main accretion phase. Stellar masses are
needed to investigate the shape of the initial mass function (IMF)
and its possible dependence on the properties of the parent cloud.
However, obtaining reliable stellar masses is a very difficult task.
Recently, considerable advances have been made in our under-
standing of PMS evolution (Palla & Stahler 1999; Siess, Dufour
& Forestini 2000; Baraffe et al. 2002; Tognelli, Prada Moroni &
Degl’Innocenti 2011). However, differences in the evolutionary
tracks remain due to the different treatment of convection, different
opacities and differences in the zero point of the calculated ages.
This results in considerable differences in mass estimates of single
stars from their effective temperatures and luminosities. Without
adequate observational constraints, it is impossible to determine the
correct assumptions in the evolutionary model calculations. For this
reason, it is very important to obtain independent determinations of
PMS masses and ages.


A possibility is that the relation νmax–age found by Zwintz et al.
(2014) is not always present in young clusters/associations (Stahler
& Palla 2014). 

In any case, this result is different from that observed in
NGC 2264 studied by (Zwintz et al. 2014). Interestingly, NGC
2264 is known to have a median age of∼3 Myr, and a signif-
icant dispersion of the order of∼5 Myr (see also Dahm 2008). (LIKE NGC 6383)

% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...846..110D/abstract

As mentioned above, differential reddening makes it impossible to identify bona fide PMS stars based on their broadband photometry alone. Instead, we search for stars with a strong  excess emission. This feature is characteristic of low-mass star formation and is attributed to the gravitational energy released by infalling matter that ionizes and excites the surrounding gas (e.g., Königl 1991; Shu et al. 1994). A reliable method to detect these objects using multicolor photometry is addressed in a series of papers by De Marchi et al. (2010, 2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2013a), to which we refer the reader.

The radial distributions of these objects are shown in Figure 4, drawn from the nominal center of R136. De Marchi et al. (2011c) had already shown that stars younger than 5 Myr (short-dashed line) follow remarkably well the distribution of reference UMS stars (solid line, rescaled by a factor of 0.65 to ease the comparison), while stars older than 5 Myr (long-dashed line) have a rather uniform distribution. The dotted line shows for comparison the distribution of stars between the 5 and 10 Myr isochrones (the latter is not shown in Figure 3 but is also from the models of Tognelli et al. 2011). The dotted line confirms that even the least old PMS candidates have a radial distribution different from that of UMS stars. Thus, we can safely use the nearby reference UMS stars to derive a reddening correction also for similarly young PMS candidates, but not for the older ones.

We find a clear anti-
correlation, shown in Figure 13, between the frequency of the
identified PMS stars and their distance from the ionizing ob-
jects (marked with blue star symbols in Figure 14). This effect
is not seen for non-PMS objects of similar brightness, whose
distribution is uniform over the whole field, confirming that the
trend is not due to problems in detecting faint objects near the
brightest stars. The trend remains the same whether the baricen-
ter of the hot stars is computed using as weight their bolometric
luminosity or their ionizing flux. This anti-correlation is quite
remarkable in several ways, as we discuss below.

Panagia et al. (2000) had already pointed out that there is no
overdensity of young PMS objects around hot massive stars in
this field. This shows that low-mass and massive stars do not
follow each other, suggesting that their formation mechanisms
are separate and distinct. But what Figure 14 additionally shows
is that there are very few PMS stars with strong Hα luminosity
(red squares) around the young massive stars, with only 20%
of them within a 70 arcsec radius of the baricenter. Conversely,
stars with low Hα luminosity (white squares) are distributed
rather uniformly across the field.

The fact that PMS objects near the youngest hot stars are both
less numerous and fainter in Hα emission suggests that their
circumstellar disks have been considerably eroded and made
less efficient by enhanced photo-evaporation

Recent theoretical studies of the erosion of circumstellar
disks via photo-evaporation due to external FUV radiation (e.g.,
Adams et al. 2004) or to the PMS star itself (e.g., Alexander
et al. 2006a, 2006b) suggest timescales of order 8–10 Myr for
the complete dissolution of the disks. Although this is the right
order of magnitude for the timescale of the process that we see,
there are still some discrepancies. For instance, it is clear that if
disks were to completely dissolve under the effect of their own
central star within 5–10 Myr, as suggested by Alexander et al.

\subsection{MASS SEGREGATION IN VERY YOUNG OPEN CLUSTERS:
A CASE STUDY OF NGC 2244 AND NGC 6530}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....134.1368C/abstract
For both clusters, the model profiles tend to roughly follow the
observational data points in the outer regions, but not in detail. This
suggests that both clusters do not have well-defined outer radii, but
are instead characterized by a significant amount of substructure.
////
The traditional explanation for (position dependent) mass
segregation in an open cluster is that it results from a situation in
which all cluster stars approach energy equipartition. However,
this is unlikely to be the case for NGC 2244 and NGC 6530, since
both clusters are very young, low-density objects (but see Portegies
Zwart et al. 2007 for counterarguments). With ages of only around
2–3 Myr, their ages are comparable to the timescale of about only
one or two crossing times.
Theoretically, the nature and degree of ‘‘primordial’’ mass seg-
regation, i.e., mass segregation intrinsic to the star formation pro-
cess itself, is presumably determined by the properties of the
interactions of protostellar material during the star-forming epi-
sode in a cluster. More massive stars are subject to more mergers,
and hence accrete even more mass (cf. Larson 1991; Bonnell
et al. 2001a, 2001b and references therein), and therefore dissipate
more kinetic energy. In addition, they tend to form near the cluster
center, in the highest density region, where the encounter rate is
highest ( Larson 1991; Bonnell et al. 1997, 1998, 2001a, 2001b;
Bonnell & Davies 1998). This will lead to an observed position-
dependent stellar mass function containing more low-mass stars at larger radii compared to the mass function in the cluster center
(although low-mass stars are still present at small radii; see also
the discussions in de Grijs et al. [2002a, 2002b]; but see Portegies
Zwart et al. [2007] for arguments in favor of excluding primordial
mass segregation to explain recent observations of the Arches
cluster near the Galactic center).

From an observational point of view, the study of very young
star clusters still embedded in the molecular clouds from which
they originated might give us a handle to constrain the degree of
primordial mass segregation. In the Milky Way, in three such
young star clusters mass segregation effects have been studied in
great detail in the past two decades.
While Lada et al. (1991) suggested, based on ground-based ob-
servations, that the brighter stars in NGC 2024 (and the Mon R2
complex at large) seem to be more centrally concentrated than the
fainter cluster members, this evidence was deemed inconclusive
by Carpenter et al. (1997). They argued that this result was based
on an incomplete sample of cluster members, although mass seg-
regation might be limited to the massive, bright OB stars forming
in the very center. These same authors argued that for masses be-
low 2 M , mass segregation effects in the Mon R2 complex amount
to only a 2 result.

Second, a combination of both ground-based (e.g., Hillenbrand
1997) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) observations (e.g.,
Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998) of the Orion Nebula Cluster
(ONC), and in particular of its very core, the Trapezium stars, has
presented clear evidence for mass segregation for the m >5 M
component, with some evidence for general mass segregation down
to m ’ 1 2 M ( Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998; see also the re-
view by Larson 1993).
Finally, R136, the central cluster in 30 Doradus in the Large
Magellanic Cloud ( LMC; age P3–4 Myr; cf. Hunter et al. 1995),
has been studied extensively, both from the ground and with the
HST. A variety of techniques have revealed a significant over-
abundance of high-mass stars in its very center, thus supporting
strong mass segregation (e.g., Campbell et al. 1992; Larson 1993;
Malumuth & Heap 1994; Brandl et al. 1996).
Thus, in most of the (still partially embedded ) young star clus-
ters that can be resolved in individual stars, mass segregation ef-
fects are observed, although to varying degrees. This underlines
the importance of our understanding of the physical processes
involved in the formation and evolution of star clusters, and in par-
ticular of the IMF, which will ultimately determine the timescale
on which a young star cluster will eventually be destroyed.
We may conclude from the above discussion that the observed
spatial mass segregation in the young open clusters NGC 2244
and NGC 6530 might have resulted from a combination of both
initial conditions in the early stages of evolution and, possibly, a
two-body relaxation process. The latter process will lead to a man-
ifestation of cluster-wide mass segregation on the half-mass relax-
ation timescale. However, it will proceed much faster in higher
density regions in the cluster, and among the more massive stars—both of these conditions favor a decreased timescale in
the cluster center.

The precise dissolution timescale de-
pends sensitively on the IMF mass range (M. B. N. Kouwenhoven
et al. 2007, in preparation). This conclusion is supported by argu-
ments related to the cluster’s velocity dispersion. Its intrinsic
overall velocity dispersion is int
tot ¼ 4:45 0:15 mas yr 1; at
the adopted distance, D¼ 1:7 kpc, this is equivalent to int
tot ’
35 km s 1
.
3 This large linear velocity dispersion is significantly
in excess of the ‘‘typical’’ velocity dispersions of older open clus-
ters in the Milky Way characterized by a Salpeter-type IMF or the
equivalent (R. de Grijs et al. 2007, in preparation). Thus, the com-
bination of these arguments leads us to conclude that NGC 2244
will most likely dissolve on a short timescale (see also Li & Smith
[2005b] for a more conservative back-of-the-envelope calculation
supporting our conclusion)—if not due to internal two-body re-
laxation effects, then most likely because of external shocks ex-
pected to operate near its location in, or close to, the Galactic disk
(although we note that these effects may not be very significant in
the Galactic anticenter direction).

Both clusters show clear evidence of mass segregation, but
there is no definite evidence for a velocity (dispersion)—mass (or,
equivalently, velocity-luminosity) dependence in these clusters.
The observed mass segregation might be due to a combination of
both initial conditions and relaxation processes.
3. Based on arguments related to the clusters’ IMFs, in con-
junction with our new measurements of their internal velocity dis-
persions, we provide strong arguments in favor of the dissolution
of NGC 2244 on very short timescales, while we speculate that
NGC 6530 may be more stable against the effects of internal two-
body relaxation.

\subsection{New Insights into the Structure of Open Clusters in the Gaia Era}
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...54Z/abstract


The internal evolution processes of star clusters mainly
include mass loss due to stellar evolution and mass loss due to
relaxation. For clusters with age∼10–100 Myr, the stellar
evolution has its greatest effects. Subsequently, the in uence of
mass loss caused by stellar evolution decreases gradually. At
the same time, the relaxation-driven mass-loss mechanism
becomes the dominant factor in the internal evolution of star
clusters, although mass loss driven by this mechanism takes a
much longer timescale (Krumholz et al. 2019). The evolution
trend we observed is generally consistent with the internal
evolution of star clusters, including key time stages:
1. At cluster ages from 3 to 40 Myr, due to the in uence of
the supernova explosion, the cluster begins to lose lots of gas
mass, which makes the gravitational potential well become
shallow, and the cluster system becomes super-virial. The
mass-loss process makes the stars have an outward bulk1. At cluster ages from 3 to 40 Myr, due to the in uence of
the supernova explosion, the cluster begins to lose lots of gas
mass, which makes the gravitational potential well become
shallow, and the cluster system becomes super-virial. The
mass-loss process makes the stars have an outward bulk motion, which leads to an increase in the cluster radii of all
components. Because of the shallower potential well, the outer
halo region loses more mass and leads to more rapid expansion.

2. For clusters with ages from 40 Myr to 1 Gyr, the mass loss
of them will gradually be dominated by the envelope shedding of
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although this process is
more gradual, it will lose 40% of the cluster’s total mass during
this stage. Furthermore, when more member stars escape to the
distant region and become eld stars, the size of the cluster is
also gradually decreasing, especially the looser outer halo region.
3. When the cluster age is greater than 1 Gyr, the mass loss due
to stellar evolution gradually stops, while the total mass loss
driven by the stellar evolution will not reach 50% until ages on
the order of a Hubble time. For old clusters (>100 Myr), the
relaxation-driven mass loss begins to dominate in the internal
evolution of clusters and leads to slower mass loss.

4.3 Mass segregation and cluster age
Mass segregation in open clusters is believed to increase with age,
with old clusters thought to be more frequently mass segregated than
young clusters (Kroupa 1995; Dib, Schmeja & Parker 2018). 

The variation of the degree of mass segregation with age was also
studied by Tarricq et al. (2022) for their open clusters (see their
section 5) using the same λMSR prescription. They had defined λ10
as the MSR for the 10 most massive members to compare the degree
of mass segregation between clusters. They had found no correlation
of λ10 with age. Given the variation of the λMSR values with Nmassive,
we do not think it is appropriate to compare the degree of mass
segregation between clusters by restricting the comparison to the
λMSR for any one Nmassive value. Finding an appropriate quantifiable
comparison between these profiles for different clusters is beyond

\subsection{Deciphering Star Cluster Evolution by Shape Morphology}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912....5H/abstract

As shown in Figure 2, the ellipticities and orientations of both
the cluster cores and the entirety of the sample clusters (hereafter
the overalls) are presented in the Galactic coordinate system. The
clusters in our sample are distributed around the Galactic plane
within the range of the Galactic latitude (b) from−40° to 40°. The
histograms of the orientations of the cluster’s cores and overalls
are presented in Figure 3, which shows that the orientations of
most clusters in the sample are within ∣ ∣ q <45°, which is basically
consistent with the nding of Zhai et al. (2017). This means that
the sample of open clusters is more elongated in a direction
parallel to the Galactic plane than perpendicular to it, consistent
with the nding of Bergond et al. (2001).

3.1. Correlations between Ellipticities and the Ages, Number of
Member Stars, and Masses of the Clusters
With the ellipticities (ecore and eall) of the sample clusters
obtained, we investigate the correlations between the ellipti-
cities and the ages, the number of member stars, and the masses
of the clusters. Figure 4 shows the ellipticities (ecore and eall) as
a function of the ages of the sample clusters. The gure
indicates that with age, the overalls of the open clusters become
more elliptical while their inner cores remain circular or
slightly trend to circularize, which is consistent with what was
inferred by Chen et al. (2004) and Zhai et al. (2017). It should
be expected that the core of a star cluster gets gradually more
circular with age due to stellar dynamics, whereas the overall
shape of a cluster continues to be elongated by external forces
such as Galactic tides, Galactic differential rotation, or
encounters with giant molecular clouds, and so on. We should
note that the signi cance of the linear t to our sample is not
strong, moreover, the shape parameters tted possibly deviate
from their true value due to the projection effect. More samples
with three-dimensional information are needed to determine the
true morphological evolution of the clusters over time.

Figure 5 shows the ellipticities of the sample clusters (ecore
and eall) as a function of the number of member stars. From this
gure, it can be concluded that both the inner ellipticities and
the overall ellipticities of the clusters are negatively correlated
with the number of member stars of the clusters, which may
imply that the higher the number of member stars of the
clusters, the stronger the cluster’s gravitational binding to resist
the external disturbances, and the more it can keep a smaller
ellipticity. Therefore, clusters with more members should be
able to go through a relatively stable shape evolution and thus
survive for a long time in an arcane and complex dynamical
environment. Conversely, the clusters with fewer members are
more likely to disintegrate into eld stars.

3.3. Influence of Galactic Tides and Differential Rotation on
Cluster Morphology

We use the overall ellipticities of the clusters at two different
directions in the Galactic plane to trace the in uence of the
Galactic tides and differential rotation on the cluster morph-
ology. The following coordinate systems for the location of
open clusters are applied: the spherical Galactic coordinates
l b , ( )
, and the XYZ coordinates in a Galactic reference frame
centered on the Sun where these position parameters ( )
X Y Z , ,
are directly obtained from Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018). Since
the cluster morphology is perpendicular to our line of sight,
when the sight direction is at l= 90° or 270°, we see their (X,
Z) projection (z-axis from the Galactic center to the north
Galactic pole), revealing the full elongation toward the Galactic
center. It is assumed that the elongation of the cluster
morphology is mainly caused by the Galactic tides toward
the Galactic center. However, at l= 0° or 180°, we see their (Y,
Z) projection, revealing the elongation in the direction of
Galactic differential rotation. The elongated cluster morph-
ology may be mainly caused by the shear forces that existed at
the direction of the Galactic differential rotation. Therefore, the
projection effect is used to study the in uence that the Galactic
differential rotation and the Galactic tides toward the Galactic
center exert on the morphology of the clusters.
This paper shows that this means that the Galactic tides
toward the Galactic center may have more in uence than the
shear forces embedded in the Galactic differential rotation on the
overall ellipticities of our sample clusters.

Previous studies have shown that most stars
born in clusters do not remain there past the age of 10 million
years, and only about 10% of stars are observed in
gravitationally bound clusters at this age (Lada & Lada 2003).


In this study, we use the member catalog of open clusters
available in the literature (Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018) to give
the shape parameters of 265 open clusters. Meanwhile, we
conclude the following for the analysis of cluster morphology
evolution by the shape parameters:
1. The overall shapes of the sample clusters become more
elliptical as they grow older, while their core shapes remain
circular or slightly trending to circular. The orientations of
the sample clusters are within ∣ ∣ q <45°, which means that
most sample clusters are more elongated in a direction
parallel to the Galactic plane than perpendicular to it.
Hu et al.
2. There is a negative correlation between the ellipticities
and the number of member stars of the sample clusters,
implying that the higher the number of member stars of
the clusters, the stronger the cluster’s gravitational
binding to resist the external disturbances, and the more
it can keep a smaller ellipticity.
3. No signi cant correlations between the inner ellipticities
and masses and between the overall ellipticities and
masses are detected for the clusters with log(age/
year)<8. However, negative correlations of the inner
and overall ellipticities with masses are detected for the
clusters with log(age/year) 8, being especially more
signi cant between the overall ellipticities and the
masses, suggesting that the overall shapes of the clusters
may be in uenced by the cluster’s mass, in addition to
other factors.
4. For sample clusters with a high number of member stars,
the radial strati cation degree in the short-axis direction is
almost the same as that in the long-axis direction. Within
clusters in both the short-axis direction and long-axis
direction, most sample clusters with fewer members have
a larger radial strati cation range than those with more
members. The number of clusters in the sample with a
greater radial strati cation in the short-axis direction than
in the long-axis direction is almost the same as for the
opposite case. For most young sample clusters, the radial
strati cation degree of the short-axis direction is greater
than that of the long-axis direction, implying that the
degree of strati cation in both directions within the
young sample cluster might be unevenly affected by gas
dissipation processes. The tangential strati cation inside
the clusters of our sample shows a concentrated
distribution. The sample clusters with relatively large
overall ellipticity have relatively low tangential strati ca-
tion, while the clusters with a smaller overall ellipticity
near the Galactic plane are mostly in the opposite state.
Older sample clusters may exhibit lower strati cation in
the tangential direction, implying that those clusters may
continue to survive for a long time at a low level of
strati cation.
5. Our analysis of two subsamples of the distribution of
clusters in the radial and tangential directions shows that
the overall ellipticities of sample clusters may be more
susceptible to the in uence of Galactic tides toward the
Galactic center than to the shear forces embedded in
Galactic differential rotation.
6. The sample clusters appear to show a general trend of
increasing overall ellipticity from the lower right of
Region A to the upper left of Region A, which means the
loss of cluster members drives the overall cluster
morphology to become elliptical. By analyzing the
distribution of the ages and number of members of star
clusters, we suggest that NGC6791 may originate from
superclusters.

6 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
6.1 Astrometric results
The mean values of position found for the cluster members
(see Table 2) were compared with previous results from the
literature (see Table 1) by calculating the offset on equato-
rial coordinates (α, δ) with respect the values obtained in
this work. The conversion of angular measurements to lin-
ear dimensions, which gives ∆pos (position offset in parsec),
was made using the mean value of the distance mode.
The comparison of proper motion was made by calculat-
ing the offset of tangential velocity ∆µ= (∆µ2
α⋆ + ∆µ2
δ)0.5
,
given in mas yr−1 that was converted into km s−1 in the
same way we used for the position offset.
In the case of double clusters, we adopted the results for
Mrk38a and NGC 2659a as a reference, meaning that these
main groups and the single clusters present offset equal zero
in this comparative analysis.
The estimated ranges quantifying the differences and
similarities between our results and those in the literature
are shown in Table 5. The table provides the minimum and
maximum values of position and velocity offsets, along with
their respective references. Figure 9 displays the offsets ∆pos
and ∆µ for the entire sample compared with the literature,
identifying individual works by coloured bars.
First, we discuss the single clusters. Compared with our
new results, the offsets are very low, excepting the compari-
son with Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018a) data (green bars) for
NGC 2168 and NGC 6494, which are based on UCAC49
.
A possible explanation for these higher velocity offsets is
the difference in the proper motion used from a different
database, which in some cases may present larger uncertain-
ties when compared with the Gaia data. Another possible
cause of discrepancies between our results and the literature
is related to different estimates of the cluster distance. This
problem is avoided in the left panel of Fig. 9 that displays
∆pos as a function of ∆µ, both given in angular measure-
ments. Again, the points showing large offset in velocity are

are mostly consistent with what is expected for systems in equi-
librium. While it would be tempting to interpret the ⟨vR⟩/σR dis-
tribution as a function of time as an evolutionary sequence, we
stress here that it represents an instantaneous picture of the cur-
rent properties of stellar clusters and not a time evolution pattern.
The results presented in this work would not significantly change
if diﬀerent catalogs of cluster ages were adopted.

3.4. Identification of YSOs in the Sh 2-305 Region
Identi cation and characterization of YSOs in star-forming
regions (SFRs) hosting massive stars are essential steps to
examine the physical processes that govern the formation of the
next generation of stars in such regions. In this study, we have

used NIR and MIR observations of Sh 2-305 (∼18 5
×
18 5
FOV) to identify candidate YSOs based on their excess IR
emission. The identi cation and classi cation schemes are
described below.
1. Using the AllWISE catalog of WISE MIR data: the location
of WISE bands in the MIR matches where the excess
emission from cooler circumstellar disk/envelope material
in young stars begins to become signi cant in comparison
to the stellar photosphere. The procedures outlined in
Koenig & Leisawitz (2014) have been used to identify
YSOs in this region. We refer to Figure 3 of Koenig &
Leisawitz (2014) to summarize the entire scheme. This
method includes photometric quality criteria for different
WISE bands as well as the selection of candidate
extragalactic contaminants (active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
AGB stars, and star-forming galaxies). Figure 6 (left panel)
shows the [[3.4]– [4.6]] versus (H− Ks) TCD for all the
sources in the region, where three probable YSOs shown by
red dots are classi ed as Class II source.
2. Using Spitzer MIR data: as we have photometric data for
two IRAC bands 3.6 and 4.5 μm, this along with the K
band is used to plot the dereddened [[3.6]– [4.5]]0 versus
[K– [3.6]]0 TCD as shown in Figure 6 (middle panel).
The procedure outlined in Gutermuth et al. (2009) has
been used to deredden and classify sources as Class I
(green circles, 20) and Class II (red dots, 95) YSOs. This
method also includes photometric quality criteria for
different IRAC bands as well as the selection of candidate
contaminants (PAH galaxies and AGNs).
3. Using TIRSPEC and 2MASS NIR data: we combined
TIRSPEC NIR photometry (see Section 2.2) with the
2MASS catalog to make a nal catalog covering the
18 5
×
18 5 FOV of the selected Sh 2-305 region. Then
those stars whose corresponding counterparts were found
in the Spitzer or WISE catalog were removed from this
catalog to further identify YSOs which are not detected in
the WISE or Spitzer photometry, by using the NIR TCD
(Ojha et al. 2004a). In Figure 6 (right panel), we have

plotted the NIR TCD of the above stars. The solid and
thick broken curves represent the unreddened MS and
giant branches (Bessell & Brett 1988). The dotted line
indicates the locus of unreddened Classical T Tauri stars
(CTTSs) (Meyer et al. 1997). The parallel dashed lines
are the reddening vectors drawn from the tip of the giant
branch (upper reddening line), from the base of the MS
branch (middle reddening line), and from the tip of the
intrinsic CTTS line (lower reddening line). We classi ed
the sources according to their locations in the diagram
(Ojha et al. 2004a; Sharma et al. 2007; Pandey et al.
2008). The sources occupying the location between the
upper and middle reddening lines (‘F” region) are
considered to be either eld stars or Class III sources
and/or Class II sources with a small NIR excess. The
sources located between the middle and lower reddening
lines (‘T” region) are considered to be mostly CTTSs (or
Class II sources) with a large NIR excess. However, we
note that there may be overlap of the Herbig Ae/Be stars
in the“T” region (Hillenbrand 2002). Sources that are
located in the region redward of the lower reddening
vector (‘P” region) most likely are Class I objects. In
Figure 6, we have shown the location of identi ed Class I
sources with green circles (2) and Class II objects with red
dots (21).
Finally, we have merged all the YSOs identi ed based on
their IR excess emission by using different schemes to have a
nal catalog of 116 YSOs in the∼18 5
×
18 5 FOV around
Sh 2-305. The positions and magnitudes in different NIR/MIR
bands of these YSOs, along with their classi cation, are given
in Table 4. Optical counterparts for 28 of these YSOs were also
identi ed by using a search radius of 1 , and their optical
magnitudes and colors are given in Table 5.

\subsection{A WISE CENSUS OF YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS IN CANIS MAJOR}

3.2. Identifying Class I and Class II Candidates
From the list generated with the selection criteria of Section
3.1, we select YSO candidates based on their W 1−W 2 and
W 2−W 3 colors according to a slightly modified version of
the Koenig & Leisawitz (2014) criteria, which are based on
the colors of known YSOs in Taurus, extragalactic sources,
and Galactic contaminants. The modification simplifies the
criteria while excluding a small number of sources that would
have otherwise been considered Class II. Class I YSOs satisfy
all four of the following constraints:
W 2−W 3 > 2.0, W 2−W 3 < 4.5, W 1−W 2 > 0.46 ×(W 2−W 3)−0.9, and W 1−W 2 >−0.42 ×(W 2−W 3) + 2.2, (1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
while Class II YSOs satisfy these constraints:
W 1−W 2 > 0.25, (5)
W 1−W 2 < 0.71 ×(W 2−W 3)−0.07, (6)
W 1−W 2 >−1.5 ×(W 2−W 3) + 2.1, (7)
W 1−W 2 > 0.46 ×(W 2−W 3)−0.9, and (8)
W 1−W 2 <−0.42 ×(W 2−W 3) + 2.2. (9)
Note that both classes satisfy the criterion described by
Equations 3 and 8, while Class I and II YSOs fall on opposite
sides of the line described by Equations 4 and 9. These bound-
aries are illustrated in Figure 2, where the numbers in paren-

are expected to lie as well as which type of object is expected
to be the main occupant of other regions of the color-color
space. “Shock emission” refers to resolved knots of shock
emission that are prominent in W 2 (Gutermuth et al. 2009;
Koenig et al. 2012), while “PAH emission” refers to regions
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission with angular
scales similar to the FWHM of the W 3 point-spread function
(Koenig et al. 2012). Objects with colors slightly redder than
zero are predominantly asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars,
but other stars with weak infrared excesses, such as classical
Be stars, lie there as well (Koenig & Leisawitz 2014). The
transition disks lie at approximately W 1−W 2 = 0 mag but
over a range of W 2− W 3 colors, and star-forming galax-
ies, including active galactic nuclei, lie at large W 2− W 3
and small W 1−W 2 due to their PAH content (Koenig et al.
2012).
There are 6662 sources with the requisite Class I colors
and 13,191 sources with the requisite Class II colors. With
the Koenig & Leisawitz (2014) version of Equation 6, there
would have been an additional 11 objects with Class II colors,
and only two of these would satisfy the magnitude require-
ments discussed below}
\subsection{Goodbye to Chi by Eye: A Bayesian Analysis of Photometric Binaries in Six Open Clusters} 
%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...962...41C/abstract

Sophisticated N-body modeling provides predictions for the
evolution of a binary population in a star cluster (e.g., Portegies
Zwart et al. 2001; Hurley et al. 2005; Marks et al. 2011; Geller
et al. 2013a, 2013b, 2015a). Such simulations model the
gravitational interactions and stellar (and binary) evolution
processes for each star over gigayear timescales. They predict
that the binary fraction in a star cluster will be modi ed over
time by both distant two-body relaxation effects and close
encounters with other single stars and stellar systems (e.g.,
Geller et al. 2013a, 2015a). For instance, the effects of two-
body relaxation leading to mass segregation are predicted to
raise the main-sequence (MS) binary fraction in the cluster core relative to the cluster halo over time (Cote et al. 1991; Layden
et al. 1999; Fregeau et al. 2002). 


# IDEA DE AQUI, OCUPAR LOS RADIOS DE JACOBI DE HUNT & REFFERT.

Note that the uncertainties provided in Table 3 only show the 1o width of the respective posterior distributions. They do not account for uncertainties intrinsic to the stellar evolution models, those introduced by the choice of photometric filters used here (see Hills et al. 2015), or any other source of uncertainty. Therefore, these uncertainties likely do not fully describe the true precision with which we know each parameter. As one particular example, many detailed (spectro-scopic) studies have found NGC 2682 to have a near-solar metallicity (e.g., Tautvaisiene et al. 2000; Randich et al. 2006;
Pancino et al. 2010). However, the metallicity derived for NGC 2682 with BASE-9 is significantly subsolar (perhaps because of underestimated uncertainties). Nonetheless, the isochrone appears to describe the data well enough for our purposes (Figure 1).

We nd that the binary fractions in these OCs are
independent of metallicity (Figure 6). Cordoni et al. (2023)
also did not nd a signi cant correlation between binary
fraction and OC metallicity when considering the binary
fractions in 78 OCs. This lack of correlation is also seen in GCs
(Milone et al. 2012; Ji & Bregman 2015).

5.3. Impacts of Stellar Dynamics and Relaxation
Star clusters are expected to become mass segregated over
the course of a few relaxation timescales. Most of the OCs in
our sample have survived through at least one relaxation time
(Section 4.3 and Table 3), and indeed these OCs show evidence for mass segregation (though some show stronger evidence
than others, see Figures 8 and 9 and Section 4.5). Interestingly,
though NGC 2168 has not yet reached a full relaxation time, it
does show evidence of mass segregation, particularly for the
binaries (as is studied in more detail in Motherway et al. 2024).
The effects of mass segregation are also evident in the right
panel of Figure 7, where the binary fraction increases
dramatically toward the cluster centers in our sample. This
agrees with ndings for the WOCS RV binaries in our sample
(e.g., Geller & Mathieu 2012; Geller et al. 2021) and also for
similar binaries in GCs (Milone et al. 2012).

\subsection{Roche volume filling of star clusters in the Milky Way}

%%  Moreover, the lifetimes of OCs range
from a few tens of Myr to a few Gyr. Age distributions are also
given by Lamers & Gieles (2006) and Bonatto & Bica (2011).

The 3D half-mass radius rh = rh, 3D of a spherically symmetric
stellar system is typically larger than the projected (2D) half-mass
radius rh, 2D. We have rh, 3D ≈ 1.3 rh, 2D. For the Plummer model
rh, 3D/rh, 2D ≈ 1.30 can be obtained analytically.

(iii) The difference between OCs and GCs seems to be that, with
respect to the concentration, the average OC has low concentration
while the average GC has a high concentration.
(iv) A fraction of OCs may be Roche volume overfilling. How-
ever, the simple assumption of virial equilibrium breaks down for
Roche volume overfilling clusters.
(v) A closer inspection of Baumgardt et al. (2010) suggests that
there is a physically extended subsample of low-mass GCs with
rh > 10 pc, which may represent the post-core-collapse sequence
of dissolving clusters. Our sample of GCs with known orbits is too
small to confirm this scenario.
We make the following remarks.
(i) The fact that λGC ≪ 1 explains (i) why GCs are spherically
shaped as compared to the often irregularly shaped OCs, (ii) why
GCs are stable against dissolution over a Hubble time and (iii) why
not many GC tidal tails have been found observationally.
(ii) A fraction of OCs may be Roche volume overfilling (λOC >
1) at the time of their formation, but the shear forces of the tidal
field will rapidly remove the material outside the Jacobi radius.
(iii) Only if the star cluster is in virial equilibrium equation (5)
is valid. Therefore the correlation found by van den Bergh (1994)
suggests that an average GC is in virial equilibrium if we postulate
that a constant ratio λGC is reasonable with respect to the general
structure of GCs. We emphasize that the virial theorem cannot be
valid for Roche volume overfilling clusters.

\subsection{The Structure of the Young Star Cluster NGC 6231. I. Stellar Population}

%https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa76e8/pdf

Based on the exponential t to disk fractions in various star-
forming regions by Mamajek (2009), a 3.2 Myr old cluster
would be expected to have a disk fraction of∼30%, and a
6.4 Myr old cluster would be expected to have a disk fraction of
∼8%. However, selection effects in the crowded mid-
infraredimages makethe sensitivity of our Spitzer/IRAC
infrared-excess sample dif cult to estimate.

Ages are dif cult to estimate for individual pre-main-
sequence stars because a star’s placement on the HRdiagra-
mor on various color–magnitude diagramsis affected by
episodic accretion (Baraffe et al. 2009), uncertainty in models
of pre-main-sequence stellar interiors (due to convection:
Chabrier et al. 2007;magnetic elds: Mohanty et al. 2009;
and rotation: Jeffries 2009), binarity, and variability (Jeffries
et al. 2011). More complete discussions of these problems are
provided by Preibisch (2012) and Getman et al. (2014b).
Nevertheless, estimates of age that have high statistical
uncertainty may still be capable of revealing real differences
in the median ages of different groups of stars. For example,
statistical methods can be used to nd spatial gradients in
average stellar age, revealing progressive star formation
(Getman et al. 2009, 2012).

9.3.4. Mass Segregation
Mass segregation has been observed in a number of young star
clusters. For example, mass segregation is seen for high-mass stars
in some star-forming regions (e.g., the Orion Nebula Cluster;
Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998) and for low-mass stars in others
(e.g., W40; Kuhn et al. 2010). A variety of astrophysical
phenomena can produce mass segregation, making it dif cult to
test any particular model. For example, mass segregation will
appear in dynamically relaxed clusters owing to two-body
interactions in which high-mass stars lose energy and sink toward
the centers of clusters. The theoretical models for this process are
complicated. Several families of models have been discussed by
Hénon (1961), Gunn & Grif n (1979), and Gieles & Zocchi
(2015). However, mass segregation can also be induced rapidly (in
a single cluster-crossing time) in young star clusters through
violent relaxation or mergers of subclusters (McMillan et al. 2007;
Allison et al. 2009; Moeckel & Bate 2010). It may also be the case
that OB stars can only form in certain regions, leading to
primordial mass segregation. Parker et al. (2014) found that
dynamical mass segregation will increase with dynamical age as
clusters become more radially symmetric.
Although OB stars in NGC6231 are mass segregated, the
mass segregation in this cluster is not as strong as in other star-
forming regions. The differences in radial distribution between
massive stars and low-mass stars (Figure 6) are not as prominent
as in the Orion Nebula Cluster (Figure 6 from Hillenbrand
& Hartmann 1998), and the segregation does not extend down to
low-mass stars as it does in W40. On the other hand, some
other young star clusters do not show mass segregation (e.g.,
NGC 2244; Wang et al. 2008). Both NGC6231 and NGC2244
are older than Orion and W40, suggesting that mass segregation
in newly formed clusters may not be just a simple effect of
dynamical age.
Mass segregation can arise from the disintegration of an
unbound cluster if stellar velocities depend on mass because, after a
stellar association had expanded suf ciently, the distance of a star
from the center of the cluster would be proportional to its velocity.
If such a cluster had energy equipartition (s ( ) m m
v
µ-
1 2), this
would result in a power-law relation with index-1 2 between
stellar mass and characteristic radii. Figure 7 shows that the
regression line for core radius versus average mass is slightly less
steep than a-1 2 relation.

\subsection{The Age of Westerlund 1 Revisited}

%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...16B/abstract

Anomalous extinction. In our analysis, we have assumed
that the dispersion of the photometry about the best- tting
isochrone is dominated by inhomogeneous extinction, which
we quantify by measuring the standard deviation of the colors
of the bright stars. We have then applied this uniformly to all
stars, though in reality it is unlikely to affect all stars the same
way. If instead we allow the error on extinction to be larger for
just the“bridge” stars, such that for these two stars dAk = 0.06
mag (see the error on the average cluster in AK; Damineli et al.
2016), the leverage these stars will have over the best- t
solution will be reduced for the following reason. When the
errors on these points are small, their location on the CMD can
only be explained by a bright PMS; but, when the errors are
larger, they could just as easily be MS stars randomly scattered
to a redder color. The consequences of this can be seen when
we repeat our analysis with the larger errors for the“bridge”
+
stars. The best- t age becomes-
7.4 0.4
1.6 Myr, slightly older,
but with a much broader probability distribution since the
constraining power of the“bridge” stars is reduced.

The ages
derived from the PMS (∼7 Myr) and the luminosity of the
CSGs (∼10 Myr) are completely independent of one another in
terms of the relevant stellar physics. For these measurements to
be in tension with one another, each would require an absolute
level of accuracy and precision of 10%–15%. In the case of
PMS stars, it has been shown from nearby young clusters and
associations that discrepancies in the theoretical mass–radius
relation and/or synthetic photometry make this level of
precision extremely challenging (e.g., Naylor 2009; David
et al. 2019)

\subsection{THE SPOTS MODELS: A GRID OF THEORETICAL STELLAR EVOLUTION TRACKS AND ISOCHRONES
FOR TESTING THE EFFECTS OF STARSPOTS ON STRUCTURE AND COLORS}


%https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891...29S/abstract

Theoretical models of the structure and evolution of
stars are enormously important for interpreting observ-
able stellar properties. As such, a large number of suites
of theoretical evolutionary tracks and isochrones have
been produced over the years and are available in the
literature. The vast majority of these calculations can
be described as “standard stellar models”, meaning that
they neglect the impact of phenomena such as stellar ro-
tation, magnetism, binary interactions, and mass loss.
This framework has proved quite successful in predict-
ing the behavior of stars in a wide variety of astrophys-
ical contexts. However, the success of standard mod-
els has not been universal. One era of stellar evolution
where models have been less accurate is the pre-main
sequence, where a number of physical eﬀects which are
less pronounced or absent in older systems influence the
evolutionary trajectory of stars: accretion from circum-
stellar material, magnetic interactions with their proto-
garrettsomers@gmail.com
planetary discs, powerful dynamo-generated magnetic
fields, strong starspot activity, and rapid rotation. Such
eﬀects cannot be addressed in the standard model frame-
work.
Unsurprisingly then, a number of problems arise when
comparing the predictions of theoretical models to the
observed properties of young stars. To name a few: the
inferred ages of pre-main sequence stars can diﬀer sig-
nificantly between objects within the same cluster (e.g.
Pecaut et al. 2012; Malo et al. 2014; Herczeg & Hil-
lenbrand 2015; Pecaut & Mamajek 2016; Feiden 2016);
the colors predicted by model atmospheres diﬀer in pe-
culiar ways from observations (Gullbring et al. 1998;
Pecaut & Mamajek 2013); and the observed lithium
abundance patterns of young clusters disagree with the
predictions of standard stellar models (Soderblom et al.
1993; Somers & Pinsonneault 2014, 2015b; Jeﬀries et al.
2017) in a manner that cannot be reconciled without
invoking the physical processes that standard models
neglect (Pinsonneault 1997). These modeling discrep-
ancies are problematic. Numerous questions of astro-
physical importance rely on the accurate modeling of
young stars, such as the circumstellar disk and exoplanet
evolution timescales, studies of the initial mass function
(IMF) of star formation, and galactic chemical evolu-
tion.

Rotation and magnetism are clearly important for
young stars, and their inclusion is, in our view, phys-
ically well-motivated. Rotation induces mixing, impor-
tant for older stars, and changes stellar structure. How-
ever, because stars spin down as they age, the departure
from spherical symmetry is modest, leading to relatively
small direct structural eﬀects. As a result, in the young
star context the direct eﬀect of rotation is real but ex-
pected to be modest.

Stellar activity induced by magnetism, by contrast,
can have a substantial impact on both the interpretation
of observables (such as colors) and theoretical models
for cool stars. The surface of a spotted star does not
have a unique temperature, and because the fraction of
the surface area covered in spots can be large, these ef-
fects can be substantial. Even early on, the colors of
active stars were seen to be diﬀerent from those of inac-
tive counterparts (Campbell 1984); these diﬀerences are
large enough that distinct empirical color-mean surface
temperature relations are needed for active and inactive
cool stars (Pecaut & Mamajek 2013). Magnetic fields
are known to inhibit convection in sunspots, and they
could also clearly impact energy transport, and by ex-
tension stellar structure, in heavily spotted stars. A
number of papers have incorporated models of magnetic
eﬀects into stellar interiors models to establish their pre-
dicted influences (e.g Spruit 1982; Spruit & Weiss 1986;
Mullan & MacDonald 2001; Chabrier et al. 2007; Feiden
& Chaboyer 2013; Jackson & Jeﬀries 2014; Somers &
Pinsonneault 2015a; Azulay et al. 2017, and references
therein). These papers have provided explanations for a
number of outstanding problems with pre-main sequence
stars.
